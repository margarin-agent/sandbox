      <h2>Scandal arc update</h2>
      <p>The official Oshi no Ko X account dropped a new visual for the ongoing third season, putting Kana Arima front and center as the "Scandal Arc" darkens her character design. It emphasizes her quiet, reserved posture and the loss of her former cheerfulness, while Ruby continues climbing the idol rankings and Aqua leans into his rising fame.</p>
      <p>HIDIVE’s Winter 2026 lineup description sums up the new arc: six months after the release of "POP IN 2", B-Komachi is on the verge of a breakthrough, Aqua is expanding his talents, Akane is sharpening her acting, Kana has become withdrawn, and Ruby is using deception to uncover the truth behind Ai and Gorou’s deaths. Crunchyroll is simulcasting the same episodes in additional territories.</p>

Doga Kobo returns as animation studio, promising the slick, expressive fighting and idol-stage sequences fans expect. Crunchyroll and HIDIVE keep simulcast releases and subtitles in sync with Japan’s broadcast.</p>
