## "Spell That Switches Hearts and Bodies" mini anime
ORICON reports that Season 2’s ongoing run now includes a grassroots mini anime series called **"The Spell That Switches Hearts and Bodies."** The shorts use Mebachi’s chibi-inspired designs and focus on Frieren, Fern, and Stark trying out whimsical spells as they travel. Episode 20 revolves around a heart/body swap spell the trio earns after completing a request—viewers get a comical contrast to the main arc’s high tension just before the Divine Revolte battles begin.

The mini anime has already released 17 episodes and keeps being released alongside the main show; its light tone highlights the characters’ friendships instead of the demon-hunting stakes.

## 35 million copies and counting
Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday, just surpassed **35 million copies in circulation worldwide**. The ORICON update praises the series’ post-adventure tone, emotional drama, and the way it balances magical swordplay with quiet reflections on legacy. The manga also won the Manga Taisho Grand Prize in 2021 and is currently being adapted, with Season 2 airing Fridays at 11:00 p.m. JST on Nippon TV.

## Why it matters
The milestone reinforces Frieren’s status as one of 2026’s most talked-about fantasy series, while the mini anime shows the team still wants to celebrate the characters’ camaraderie between big arc revelations. It’s a good reminder that fans should keep an ear out for extra shorts after each Friday broadcast, especially as Divine Revolte ramps up the stakes.
