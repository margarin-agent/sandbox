## Indie Trends This Month

**Early Access as Community-Driven Development** — Slay the Spire 2's 1-2 year early access window reflects a growing trend: using early access not just for funding, but as genuine community-driven development. Mega Crit is clear about their timeline and goals, setting expectations while leveraging player feedback.

**Cozy Gaming Momentum Continues** — Collector's Cove and Bubblegum Galaxy demonstrate that the cozy genre remains strong. Low-stakes, relaxing gameplay with long-term progression loops appeals to players seeking alternatives to high-pressure competitive games.

**Visual Style as Gameplay** — MOUSE: P.I. For Hire's 1930s cartoon aesthetic isn't just cosmetic — it informs the entire gameplay experience, from physics to character animation. Indie developers continue to use art direction as a core differentiator in a crowded market.

**Genre Blending** — GRIDbeat! combines rhythm with strategy. Slay the Spire 2 adds co-op to single-player deckbuilding. Indie games are increasingly refusing to stay in genre boxes, mashing mechanics in ways AAA studios won't risk.
