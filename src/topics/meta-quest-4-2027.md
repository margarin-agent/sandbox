# Meta Quest 4 — The VR Reset

**Meta's next VR headset is becoming something entirely different**

February 2026 reports reveal that Meta's VR roadmap has undergone a dramatic reset. The Quest 4 isn't coming in 2026 anymore — it's been pushed to **2027 or even 2028** as Reality Labs pivots strategy from a traditional refresh to a fundamental rethink of what a VR headset should be.

## Delayed Timeline

Early rumors pegged Quest 4 for a late 2026 launch, following Meta's usual October window. That timeline is now increasingly unlikely:

- **Current estimates:** 2027-2028 for Quest 4 release
- **Puffin/Phoenix ultralight headset:** Targeting first half of 2027
- **Traditional Quest 4:** No earlier than second half of 2027

The delay traces back to messy reshuffling at Meta Reality Labs, where priorities have bounced between standalone headsets, lightweight mixed reality glasses, and smart eyewear — sometimes within the same quarter.

## The Codename Chaos

Meta's internal roadmap hasn't been a clean line from Quest 3 to Quest 4:

- **Pismo Low & Pismo High** — Budget and premium tier Quest 4 candidates — both shelved
- **Griffin** — New Quest 4 work after Pismo cancellation
- **Puffin (also called Phoenix)** — Ultra-light mixed reality headset with tethered puck

This tells you the company didn't pause development — it rebooted it.

## Display: 4K Micro-OLED

Leaks consistently point to **4K Micro-OLED panels**, a real step up from Quest 3's dual LCD setup at 2064 x 2208 per eye:

- **Deeper blacks** and sharper contrast
- **Faster pixel response** — better for dark environments and MR passthrough
- **Same tech** as Apple Vision Pro, but expensive to produce at scale

The display upgrade explains the expected price jump. Micro-OLED panels are costly, and Quest 4's floor price won't look like what brought millions into VR with the Quest 2.

## Eye & Face Tracking as Standard

Quest Pro introduced eye and face tracking in 2022, but those features never reached the mainline Quest series. That changes with Quest 4:

- **Eye tracking enables foveated rendering** — fully render only what you're looking at, relax GPU on peripheral vision
- **Face tracking fixes the blank-avatar problem** in social VR, making lip sync and expressions feel natural
- Both features are reportedly coming **standard**, not as premium add-ons

If Meta can miniaturize those sensors for a slimmer frame, that's a clean engineering win.

## Price Hike Expected

Meta heavily subsidized Quest 2 and Quest 3, selling hardware at or below cost. That strategy appears to be winding down:

- **Expected price:** Higher than Quest 3's $499 launch point
- **Rumors:** Around $800 suggested by some sources
- The $299 entry-level headset that brought millions into VR is probably gone for good

At $800, you won't forgive a plastic-heavy build the way you did at $299. That pressure falls squarely on display quality, tracking, and comfort.

## Design: Ski Goggles, Not Bricks

Meta Reality Labs showed off a prototype with a **goggle-like form factor** and a claimed 180-degree field of view:

- **Slimmer build** combined with Micro-OLED
- **Closer to ski goggles** than chunky headsets
- **Comfort is key** — single biggest factor in whether people actually use VR after first week

If Meta nails this, Quest 4 could be the first Quest people genuinely forget they're wearing.

## Puffin: The Ultra-Light Experiment

While Quest 4 waits, Meta is pushing Puffin forward:

- **Weight:** Under 110 grams (like bulky glasses)
- **Architecture:** Offloads processing and battery to pocket-sized puck
- **No controllers:** Uses gaze-and-pinch input like Apple Vision Pro
- **Focus:** Virtual screens for productivity and entertainment

The tethered approach is similar to Vision Pro, but Puffin goes further by moving the processor out of the headset entirely. Meta internally floated "Quest Air" as the branding for this lighter device.

## Competitive Landscape

Meta no longer has the field to itself:

- **Valve's Steam Frame** — Standalone headset running SteamOS with access to Steam's massive library
- **Asus ROG Tarius** — Running Meta's own Horizon OS, could ship with eye and face tracking before Quest 4 does
- **Samsung Galaxy XR** (Project Moohan) — Runs Android XR, adding Google to OS fight
- **Apple Vision Pro** — Keeps setting technical bar at every tier

Quest 4 won't just need to be good on its own terms — it'll need to justify its place in a crowded market.

## Meta CTO: It's Still Happening

After "Quest 4 is canceled" headlines in mid-2025, CTO Andrew Bosworth pushed back:

> "Referencing two 'officially leaked' devices still on the roadmap."

The confusion was understandable — Meta canceled Pismo prototypes, cut around 10% of Reality Labs staff in early 2026, and posted over $6 billion in quarterly losses for the division. But Bosworth described a company rethinking its approach, not retreating from VR.

## Key Facts

| Spec/Feature | Expected Details |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Release Window** | 2027-2028 |
| **Display** | 4K Micro-OLED |
| **Eye Tracking** | Standard |
| **Face Tracking** | Standard |
| **Price** | ~$800 (rumored) |
| **Form Factor** | Ski goggles, 180° FOV |
| **Predecessor** | Pismo Low/High (canceled) |
| **Puffin Launch** | 2027 H1 (ultra-light variant) |

## Who Should Wait

- **Current Quest 3/3S owners:** If you're happy and not chasing specs, there's no urgency
- **Budget-conscious buyers:** The $299 entry point is gone — prepare for $800+
- **Steam gamers:** Consider Valve's Steam Frame with SteamOS integration

## Bottom Line

The Quest 4 is no longer a simple refresh — it's a hard reset of what a Quest headset means. Meta is betting that display quality, comfort, and standard tracking can justify a higher price tag. Whether that gamble pays off depends on whether they can ship before Valve, Asus, and Apple steal their thunder.

**Verdict:** Quest 4 is at least a year away. Checking back in late 2027 will give you a clearer picture without the noise.
