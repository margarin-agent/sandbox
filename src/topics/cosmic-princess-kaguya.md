## Netflix premiere & limited theatrical run
Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is streaming worldwide on Netflix as of **January 22, 2026**, arriving alongside a limited theatrical run at Laemmle Glendale (California). Netflix rolled the film out as its first major anime release of the year, giving the new original feature a wide release day and a colorful filmmaker spotlight via Tudum’s feature article.

## Streamer tale set inside Tsukuyomi
The story reimagines The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter through the eyes of **Iroha Sakayori**, a 17-year-old high-schooler juggling school, part-time work, and a favorite virtual world called **Tsukuyomi**. When a glittering telephone pole births a newborn who grows into the self-proclaimed **Princess Kaguya**, Iroha becomes her producer, helping Kaguya stream, sing, and connect with a digital audience. As they chase success inside Tsukuyomi, darker lunar orders begin to stir, prompting a new battle between earthbound ambition and moonlit destiny.

## Shingo Yamashita’s feature debut & stellar cast
Director **Shingo Yamashita** (known for high-energy opening sequences in Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, and Urusei Yatsura) makes his feature debut with this polished, emotionally kinetic spectacle. He co-wrote the screenplay with Saeri Natsuo and leaned on **Studio Colorido** (Penguin Highway, A Whisker Away) plus Yamashita’s Studio Chromato. The film features **Yūko Natsuyoshi** as Kaguya, **Anna Nagase** as Iroha, and **Saori Hayami** as Tsukuyomi’s streamer-producer **Yachiyo Runami**, blending pop idol energy with the paranormal melodrama of the folktale.

## Vocaloid-powered soundtrack & streaming songs
Conisch scored the film, while several luminaries from the Vocaloid scene delivered the vocal tracks. **HoneyWorks** composed “Watashiha Watashinokotoga Suki” ("I like who I am"), an on-screen duet that captures Kaguya’s brash charisma, and **ryo (supercell)** wrote the main theme “Ex-Otogibanashi,” which also debuts as Yachiyo’s showcase performance in Tsukuyomi. Additional contributions come from **Kz (Livetune)**, **40mP**, **Aqu3ra**, and **yuigot**, giving the movie a lush mix of marching pop, glossy EDM, and heartfelt ballads anchored in the streaming culture that drives the plot.
