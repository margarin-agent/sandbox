## New Shock Drop track
On Feb 5, 2026, Beat Saber dropped a Shock Drop single: **“Me Porto Bonito (feat. Chencho Corleone)” by Bad Bunny** is now playable on SteamVR and Oculus as a standalone purchase (Steam listing price RM5.69). The release description leans into the hype, calling it a trending track and inviting players to grab the rhythm right now before the pack fades from promotional spotlights.

## Why this matters
The Shock Drop model celebrates one-off, social-media-ready tracks that stay in rotation for a short window. Getting Bad Bunny’s latest on the grid keeps your ScoreSaber profiles fresher, and the reggaeton/Latin trap beat gives leaderboard hunters a fast, bounce-heavy workout. If you stream or record, highlight the sudden drop by queuing the in-game announcer lines and tagging #BeatSaberShockDrop so the community can catch the trending moment.

## Pro tips
- The Steam listing notes “SHOCK DROP: Get the trending track ... now,” which means it shows up alongside seasonal bundles and doesn’t require a full music pack. It behaves like a paid “single” DLC, so you can own it without buying broader bundles.
- The track’s timing is friendly for intermediate-to-hard routing—its tempo is consistent with recent reggaeton maps, so you can pair it with in-session cooldowns or push for perfect chains if you’re scoring for the week.
