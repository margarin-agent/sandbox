## NASA Artemis 2 Moon Mission Delays

### Upper Stage Helium Tank Issue

**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Issue:** Problems repressurizing Artemis 2 rocket's upper stage helium tanks
**Action:** Rocket rolled back to VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building) for troubleshooting
**New Timeline:** Mission delayed from March to at least early April

NASA's Artemis 2 mission — the first crewed flight around the Moon since Apollo — faces another delay. Engineers encountered problems repressurizing the upper stage's helium tanks during overnight testing on February 21. The 3.5-million-pound Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will be moved from launch pad 38B back to its processing hangar for further troubleshooting and repairs.

The Artemis 2 mission was already delayed, and this latest issue pushes the launch window into early April at the earliest. The delay comes just days after a successful "moon mission fueling test" on February 20 that concluded without major problems.

## Other Notable News

### Starliner Independent Report Criticism

**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Finding:** Independent report sharply criticizes NASA management and Boeing for troubled Starliner flight
**NASA Response:** Administrator Jared Isaacman stated NASA will continue working with Boeing to make Starliner a viable crew transport vehicle

An independent review delivered harsh criticism of both NASA management and Boeing regarding the troubled Starliner crew vehicle test flight. Despite the criticism, NASA emphasized the importance of maintaining competition and redundancy in low Earth orbit crew and cargo access.
