## Engineered Bacteria Consume Cancer Tumors from Within

**Published:** February 24, 2026

**Institution:** University of Waterloo, Canada

Scientists at the University of Waterloo are developing a revolutionary cancer treatment using specially engineered bacteria to consume tumors from the inside. The strategy exploits the unique environment inside solid tumors—oxygen-free cores teeming with nutrients—as the perfect breeding ground for anaerobic microbes.

### How It Works

At the center of this approach is *Clostridium sporogenes*, a bacterium commonly found in soil that survives only in absolutely oxygen-free environments. The inner core of solid tumors, composed of dead cells and devoid of oxygen, creates ideal conditions for these microbes to multiply and spread.

"Bacteria spores enter the tumor, finding an environment where there are lots of nutrients and no oxygen, which this organism prefers, and so it starts eating those nutrients and growing in size," explains Dr. Marc Aucoin, a chemical engineering professor at Waterloo. "So, we are now colonizing that central space, and the bacterium is essentially ridding the body of the tumor."

### Overcoming the Oxygen Barrier

The challenge: as bacteria expand outward and reach tumor areas exposed to small amounts of oxygen, they begin dying before fully eliminating the cancer.

To address this, the team inserted a gene from a related bacterium that's more tolerant of oxygen, allowing engineered microbes to survive longer near the tumor's outer regions.

**Quorum Sensing Control System**

To prevent premature activation (which could allow bacteria to grow in oxygen-rich areas like the bloodstream), they used quorum sensing—a natural bacterial communication process. Only after enough bacteria accumulate inside a tumor does the chemical signal reach the level that switches on the oxygen-resistant gene.

"Using synthetic biology, we built something like an electrical circuit, but instead of wires we used pieces of DNA," explains Dr. Brian Ingalls, professor of applied mathematics at Waterloo. "Each piece has its job. When assembled correctly, they form a system that works in a predictable way."

### Next Steps

The team is combining the oxygen-tolerance gene and quorum-sensing control system into a single bacterium for evaluation in pre-clinical trials.

## Universal Nasal Spray Vaccine Protects Against Multiple Respiratory Threats

**Published:** February 19, 2026 in *Science*
**Source:** ScienceDaily
**Institution:** Stanford Medicine

Researchers at Stanford Medicine have developed an experimental universal vaccine that shields against a broad range of respiratory viruses, bacteria, and even allergens. Administered intranasally (nasal spray), it provides wide-ranging protection in the lungs that lasts for months.

### Protection Achieved (in mice)

- **Viruses:** SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses
- **Bacteria:** *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Acinetobacter baumannii* (common hospital-acquired infections)
- **Allergens:** House dust mites

The level of protection across so many unrelated respiratory threats exceeded expectations, according to senior author Dr. Bali Pulendran, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford Medicine.

### Breaking the 230-Year-Old Vaccine Paradigm

Since the late 1700s, when Edward Jenner introduced vaccination (from Latin *vacca* for "cow"), vaccines have relied on **antigen specificity**—presenting the immune system with a recognizable pathogen piece (like the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2) for future recognition.

The problem: many pathogens evolve quickly. When viruses change surface structures, previously effective vaccines lose potency—necessitating updated COVID boosters and annual flu shots.

"That's been the paradigm of vaccinology for the last 230 years," notes Pulendran. "It's becoming increasingly clear that many pathogens are able to quickly mutate. Like the proverbial leopard that changes its spots, a virus can change the antigens on its surface."

### New Strategy: Activating Integrated Immunity

Instead of copying a virus or bacterium, this vaccine **imitates immune cell communication signals during infection**, linking the body's two main defense systems:

- **Innate immunity:** Responds within minutes, acts broadly, typically fades within days
- **Adaptive immunity:** Produces antibodies and specialized T cells, retains memory for years

**Key Discovery (2023):** Pulendran's team found that the BCG tuberculosis vaccine triggered unusually long-lasting innate immunity (3 months in mice), sustained by T cells sending signals that kept innate immune cells activated.

### How the Nasal Vaccine Works

The formulation (GLA-3M-052-LS+OVA) replicates T cell signals that stimulate innate immune cells in the lungs. It includes:

1. **Toll-like receptor stimuli** to activate innate immune cells
2. **Ovalbumin (OVA)** as a harmless antigen drawing T cells into the lungs

**Results (mice):**
- Three doses provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for at least 3 months
- Unvaccinated mice: severe weight loss, high viral levels, extensive lung inflammation, death
- Vaccinated mice: minimal weight loss, survival, little virus in lungs

**"Double Whammy" Effect:**
- Sustained innate response reduced viral levels in lungs by 700-fold
- Any viruses bypassing the first layer were confronted by rapid adaptive response (3 days vs 2 weeks normally)

### Potential Impact

If similar results are achieved in humans, a single vaccine could:
- Replace multiple yearly shots for seasonal respiratory illnesses
- Provide rapid protection if a new pandemic virus emerges

## Triplet Superconductors: The "Holy Grail" of Quantum Computing

**Published:** February 21, 2026

**Institution:** Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), QuSpin Research Centre

Researchers at NTNU's QuSpin center may have observed the long-sought **triplet superconductor**—a material considered the "holy grail" of quantum technology and quantum computing.

### Why Triplet Superconductors Matter

**Conventional (Singlet) Superconductors:**
- Allow electricity to flow without resistance (zero energy loss as heat)
- Superconducting particles do *not* carry spin
- Limitations in quantum computing applications

**Triplet Superconductors:**
- Superconducting particles *do* carry spin
- Can transport both electrical currents *and* spin currents with absolutely zero resistance
- Could enable information transmission using spin without energy loss
- Could allow extremely fast computers operating on almost no electricity

"The fact that triplet superconductors have spin has an important consequence. We can now transport not only electrical currents but also spin currents with absolutely zero resistance," explains Professor Jacob Linder of NTNU's Department of Physics. "That ability could make it possible to transmit information using spin without any energy loss. In turn, extremely fast computers could operate using almost no electricity at all."

### The Discovery: NbRe Alloy

The team identified a niobium-rhenium (NbRe) alloy exhibiting properties consistent with triplet superconductivity. Both elements are rare metals.

Key observations:
- Material behaves completely differently from conventional singlet superconductors
- Superconductivity at 7 Kelvin (just above absolute zero at -273.15°C)
- 7K is comparatively "warm" in superconductivity terms (other potential triplet superconductors require temperatures near 1K)

"It is still too early to conclude once and for all whether the material is a triplet superconductor," Linder cautions. "Among other things, the finding must be verified by other experimental groups. It is also necessary to carry out further triplet superconductivity tests."

Even so, the results are encouraging.

### Published Research

Co-authored with experimental collaborators in Italy, the study was published in *Physical Review Letters* and selected as one of the journal's editor's recommendations.

### Stabilizing Quantum Technology With Spin

Linder's research focuses on quantum materials for **spintronics**—using spin to carry and process information differently from conventional electronics.

"One of the major challenges in quantum technology today is finding a way to perform computer operations with sufficient accuracy," Linder explains. "Triplet superconductors could help solve that problem."
