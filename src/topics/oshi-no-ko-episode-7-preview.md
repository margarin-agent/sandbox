## What to watch for
Episode 7 keeps pushing the Scandal Arc forward. Six months after POP IN 2, MEM-Cho’s grind is finally paying off and B-Komachi is on the verge of a major breakthrough. Aqua is juggling a multi‑talented entertainer career, Akane’s acting path is steady, and Kana now hides most of the brightness she once had. Ruby, however, keeps climbing within the industry, using her public image as bait to unearth the truth behind Ai and Goro’s deaths.

The preview synopsis teases a tense agency scene: Kana apologizes after being photographed by a reporter, and when the others ask, “Will you still try to save Kana even if it means pain?” Ruby responds without hesitation, “Of course.” Aqua’s new method to keep Kana safe is hinted at but left as a cliffhanger in the preview stills.

## Preview visuals
The official release includes several stills showing Ruby’s determination, Kana’s shaken state, and Aqua’s grim plot to protect her.
