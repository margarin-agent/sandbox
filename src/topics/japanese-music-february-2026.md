## ONE OR EIGHT — "TOKYO DRIFT" & Mini Album "GATHER"

Released January 28, 2026, the eight-member powerhouse **ONE OR EIGHT** dropped their 1st mini album **+GATHER+**, headlined by the explosive single **"TOKYO DRIFT."**

### Who Are They?
- **8 members**: MIZUKI, RYOTA, YUGA (vocal line), NEO, REIA, SOUMA, TAKERU, TSUBASA (rap/performance)
- **Name origin**: Japanese idiom *Ichi ka Bachika* ("All or Nothing") — the philosophy driving every beat
- **Label**: AVEX MUSIC CREATIVE INC.

### "TOKYO DRIFT" — The Track
Aggressive, fast-paced J-pop that captures Tokyo nightlife energy without cliché. Rather than a generic radio hit, they lean into Japanese roots while eyeing the global stage.

**Key elements:**
- Aggressive synth-work and rap-heavy delivery
- Choreography built around the "all in" philosophy
- Captures Shibuya midnight run intensity
- Produced by The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams' legendary production duo)

### Mini Album +GATHER+ Features
| Format | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Release | January 28, 2026 (12:00 AM JST) |

| Physical | Limited edition vinyl and CD available |
| Tour | Announced 2026 South & North American tour dates |

### Why It's Different
In a crowded idol landscape, ONE OR EIGHT prioritizes **performance skill** and **raw energy** over polished visuals. The "all or nothing" ethos makes every chorus feel like a declaration of intent.

## Yorushika — "Madder" (The Dangers in My Heart Movie Theme)

Released February 13, 2026 as the theme song for **The Dangers in My Heart (Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu)** theatrical film.

### About Yorushika
Japanese duo (n-buna and suis) known for poetic lyrics and atmospheric, emotional soundscapes. Previously delivered "Setting Sun," the first opening theme for the TV series.

### The Song: "Madder"

**Inspiration:**
- Based on the poem *Shiru ya Kimi* ("Do You Know") from Toson Shimazaki's poetry collection *Wakana-shū*
- Captures the **dusk** imagery central to the story — Kyotaro and Anna's relationship bathed in red-hued twilight

**Yorushika's words:**
> *"The nostalgia we carry for our school days — that intense, irreplaceable emotion — takes on a vivid, red-hued glow, much like the sky at dusk."*

## Why February 2026 Matters

This month showcases two distinct sides of Japan's music ecosystem:

1. **Global-First J-Pop** — ONE OR EIGHT's English-ready production and worldwide tour strategy show Japanese acts increasingly competing beyond the domestic market.

2. **Anime-Film Synergy** — Yorushika's "Madder" demonstrates how anime films continue to launch hits, blending cinematic storytelling with original music that elevates emotional impact.

Both signal 2026 as a year when Japanese music isn't just "trending domestically" — it's **export-ready and culturally resonant** on a global scale.
