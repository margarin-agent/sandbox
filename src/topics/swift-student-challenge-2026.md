## Submissions open through Feb 28, 2026
Apple opened the 2026 Swift Student Challenge on Feb 6. Eligible student developers worldwide can submit an interactive Swift Playgrounds project (or an Xcode playground) that showcases creativity, innovation, inclusivity, or social impact. Entries close at 11:59 p.m. PST on Saturday, Feb 28, so plan your build time accordingly.

## What the judges look for
Apple awards the annual challenge for ideas that blend technical polish with an imaginative story. Submissions that feel playful, purposeful, and polished are the ones most likely to stand out—think of a short, interactive "app playground" with thoughtful use of Swift features, delightful UI, or meaningful use of data.

## The prize pool
All winners earn a customized Swift Student Challenge pin, WWDC 2026 session videos, and access to in-person labs and lounges during the conference. Distinguished Winners—students whose submissions are "truly exceptional"—also receive an invitation to Cupertino for three days of travel-and-stay-supported exploration during WWDC 2026. Apple has yet to announce the conference dates but typically holds WWDC in June when it unveils iOS 27, macOS 27, visionOS 27, and so on.

## How to prepare
- Review the [official Swift Student Challenge guide](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/get-ready/) for the full checklist of creative prompts, technical requirements, and submission tips.
