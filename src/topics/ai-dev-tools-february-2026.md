### 🥈 2. Claude 4.5 Opus — Performance Champion (↓ from #1)
Despite dropping to #2, Claude 4.5 Opus still holds the crown for raw coding performance:

- **Highest SWE-bench score:** 80.9% (edging out Gemini 3 Pro at 74.2%)
- **200K context window** with 64K output
- Enhanced tool use and autonomous agent capabilities
- **Pricing:** $5/$25 — 67% cheaper than Claude 4 Opus
- **Tradeoff:** No free tier limits broader adoption

### 🥉 3. Kimi K2.5 — Open-Source Revolution (New Entry)
Moonshot AI's Kimi K2.5 enters as the **strongest open-source model**:

| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| SWE-bench Score | 76.8% |
| Video Processing | Full native support |
| Agent Swarm | Up to 100 sub-agents with 1,500 tool calls |
| Licensing | Modified MIT — self-hosting available |

**Why it matters:** The Agent Swarm feature enables massive parallel task execution, making it ideal for complex refactoring or documentation generation tasks.

### 4. Gemini 3 Pro — Multimodal Powerhouse (↓ from #3)
Google's multimodal flagship drops to #4 but remains unmatched for video/voice work:

- **SWE-bench Score:** 74.2%
- **1M context window** with full video processing
- **24-language voice input** — unique among most models
- **Pricing:** $2-4/$12-18 with free tier

**Best for:** Developers who need video analysis, voice input, or the most complete multimodal package.

### 5. GPT-5.2 — Balanced Performer (↓ from #4)
OpenAI's latest maintains strong enterprise value:

- **SWE-bench Score:** 69%
- **400K context window** (largest among new entries) with 128K output
- Full video processing and native voice/audio input
