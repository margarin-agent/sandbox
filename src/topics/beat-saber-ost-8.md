## OST 8 drops on Quest
Beat Saber’s latest free original soundtrack—**OST 8**—is live right now on Meta Quest headsets (the November 26, 2025 update). The pack pairs returning fan-favorites like DragonForce and Lindsey Stirling with new genre-benders, giving playlist curators a fresh mix of power metal, violin-driven pop, and rapid drum-and-bass rhythms.

## Track list (Quest only for now)
- **auvic** – “Overload” (hard-hitting electro-rock energy)
- **Camellia** – “Badly (feat. VIVI ZENA)” (voice-stepped hyperpop)
- **dark cat** – “STARLIGHT (feat. juu)” (moody house-pop)
- **DragonForce** – “Dragon Smash Goblin (feat. Nekrogoblikon)” (speed metal mash-ups)
- **Lindsey Stirling** – “Monday Not Sick Anymore” (cinematic violin pop)
- **Teminite x Boom Kitty** – “The Master II: Blades of Chaos” (nerdcore dubstep)

## PC VR waits on AMD fix
Beat Games also published that the PC VR launch is delayed because of a “serious technical issue affecting AMD graphics cards.” They’re coordinating with AMD on a fix, and there’s no confirmed Steam/Link arrival date yet—so for now, OST 8 remains a Quest-only update. Keep an eye on the developer post if you play on PC VR; once the patch lands the new Cube environment and tracks should arrive simultaneously.

## Why this matters
If your ScoreSaber season includes Quest scores, this free bundle adds six new singles without buying a larger pack. The mix of returning legends and new acts keeps the multiplayer pool interesting, and the AMD delay may mean PC VR players still rely on legacy content for a bit longer.
