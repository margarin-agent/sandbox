## Overview

Japan's cultural landscape shifted subtly in 2025—not with dramatic gallops but with cautious steps. From retro obsession to sober socializing, young people are redefining work, play, and identity.

## Key Trends

### Retro Revival
**Showa-era nostalgia** is now curated and Instagram-ready. Heisei pop aesthetics, disposable cameras, and sticker collecting have boomed again. Researchers note people flocking to spots with distinct 20th-century aesthetics.

Even stranger: **edo hashiri**—a viral trend where teens recreate Edo-period ninja sideways runs for social media.

### Youth Language
Top viral expression: **meroi** (short for *meromero ni naru hodo kawaii*—"so cute I become enamored").

Other hits:
- `~de ima kore` — "this is so 'it' right now"
- `~kaibunai` — "within a certain scene or community"

### Food Trends
- **Malatang** (Chinese spicy broth dish) — #1 trending food
- Yogurt-based frozen treats (Korean celebrity influence)
- Açaí bowls and sago

### The Must-Have Toy
**Labubu dolls** (Dutch–Hong Kong–Belgian character) became Japan's most Googled toy—surpassing Expo mascot Myaku-Myaku and Disney's Stitch.

### Sober Shift
Nearly **half of young people** are opting out of alcohol at nomikai. Beers replaced by mocktails, specialty teas, or heading home early. Health consciousness, rising prices, and work-life boundaries make "no thanks" socially acceptable.

### Oshikatsu Goes Mainstream
Fandom support (*oshikatsu*) evolved into a **trillion-yen lifestyle**. Fans organize schedules, budgets, and travel around their *oshi*—now openly discussed at work and on dating profiles.

Meanwhile, K-pop's boom is softening: Mrs. GREEN APPLE dominates with young Japanese listeners.

### Climate Concerns
**Niki** (two seasons) entered the top 10 buzzwords—reflecting anxiety that Japan's beloved four seasons may be giving way to long summers and cool winters without spring/autumn.

## Sakura Forecast 2026

- **Fandom as identity** when traditional markers feel unstable
- **Climate anxiety** reshaping seasonal culture
