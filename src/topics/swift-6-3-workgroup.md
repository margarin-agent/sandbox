## SSWG opens its Feb 25 sync to the public
The Swift Server Workgroup has announced that the next Wednesday sync—**Feb 25, 2:00 p.m. PST (18:00 UTC)**—will be open to anyone in the community. The meeting will run for an hour over Zoom, with the attendance link shared in this thread the day before. Community members can observe or drop agenda items up front or in the thread; remedial discussions may happen later if time allows, but no company-confidential topics are on the table. The public window is intended to become the default for most future meetings, so now is a good chance to peek at how the workgroup steers the server-side Swift roadmap.

## Documentation Tooling’s Feb 23 checkpoint
Last night’s Documentation Tooling Workgroup debrief listed Joe Heck, Vera Mitchell, Sven Schmidt, Dave Verwer, and David Ronnqvist as attendees. The team is rolling the **Swift 6.3 beta** through the overall documentation site and watching whether the new keywords/analyzed URLs make it into Google’s index. Their short-term plan: pick a handful of stable Swift pages, reshape the copy so the desired keywords are explicit, watch how rankings react after the next reindex, and repeat. That effort is bundled with a bigger push to deploy the 6.3 beta across the entire docs site—Vera points out that **Xcode 26.4 beta 1 already ships with Swift 6.3**, so the tooling team needs to track the rollout, log what worked, and keep the telemetry around stability and results as the fresh pages go live.

## Why it matters now
With Swift 6.3 beta out there and the server workgroup opening its doors, the ecosystem is consolidating around the next major release. Watching these workgroup meetings gives you a bird’s-eye view of how the 6.3 rollout is being coordinated (Zoom link + agenda threads make it easy to follow), while the docs/SEO tracking reminds you that even subtle word changes can impact developer discovery once the new APIs land.
