description: Why Macht’s golden curse, curiosity about guilt, and human mimicry make him a chilling next villain in the Divine Revolte arc.

## Mimicry hides a monster
Fandomwire’s latest deep dive teases that the Season 2 villain Macht isn’t angry or theatrical—he’s almost unnervingly composed. He puts on a civilized mask, speaks like a mentor, and can pass among humans, yet the mask is part of an experiment. Macht is fascinated with malice and guilt because demons biologically can’t feel those emotions, so he kills to observe what it means to make humans feel them. That obsession makes every encounter feel like a test rather than a grudge match.

## Di Agölze breaks the magic rules
Macht’s signature ability, **Di Agölze (Universal Golden Transmutation)**, completely sidesteps Frieren’s usual visualization + mana triangle system. It isn’t a beam or projectile; if he simply notices you, he can slap a conceptual curse on you that turns your body into indestructible gold. No known dispel, counter, or even mercy can undo it because no one has visualized how to turn gold back into living flesh. Frieren lost to him during the First Mage Exam because the curse simply ignored her strongest spells—when she can’t picture the reversal, there’s nothing left to cast.

## Why the Divine Revolte arc feels dangerous
With the anime now pivoting into the Divine Revolte arc, Macht’s presence raises the stakes beyond the Northern Travels’ gentle travelogue tone. He’s not a demon grabbing territory—he’s a demon playing scientist on humanity. That, plus his broken warping magic and cold curiosity, makes him the strongest opponent Frieren has yet faced. The anime may only taste his full might toward the El Dorado Arc, but even the current glimpses are proof that Smile Studios is asking viewers to sit with a villain who literally reduces heroes to inert treasure.
