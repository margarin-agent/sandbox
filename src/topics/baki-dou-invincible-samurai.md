## Netflix drop preview
Netflix is hosting the next Baki anime, **BAKI-DOU: The Invincible Samurai**, which premieres worldwide on **February 26, 2026**, with both Japanese and English dubs. The newly released trailer teases intense underground arena action where fighters can now wield weapons—because the legendary samurai Musashi Miyamoto is back in the modern era via a forbidden cloning experiment.

Musashi is voiced by **Naoya Uchida** in Japanese (English actor TBD) and stands as the “ultimate warrior,” a sword saint whose revival sends shockwaves through Tokyo and beyond. The synopsis leans into a time-transcending showdown: the world’s greatest combat enthusiast, Mitsunari Tokugawa, resurrects Musashi beneath the Tokyo Skytree, drawing Baki, Yujiro, and the underground arena’s fiercest fighters into a battle to crown the strongest warrior in history.

## Creative team & music
- **Director:** Toshiki Hirano (TMS Entertainment)
- **Series composition:** Tatsuhiko Urahata
- **Character designs:** Shingo Ishikawa
- **Editor:** Yuriko Sano
- **Composer:** Kenji Fujisawa
- **Opening theme:** “FURUBOKO” by WANIMA
- **Ending theme:** “Mountain Top” by Novel Core

## Why it matters
This arc introduces weapon-wielding bouts and a supernatural revival of Musashi, blending manga lore with Netflix-scale production. If you follow Baki, the trailer’s mix of practical and sci-fi vibes (secret lab, cloning, time-displacing warriors) makes this feel like a return to big-stakes gladiator battles with a mythic twist.
