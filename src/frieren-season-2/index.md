## Winter 2026 progress
Frieren Season 2 keeps rolling with the Continued Northern Travels arc. Each new Friday drops on Crunchyroll while the official English dub follows a few weeks later.

## Release schedule (JST)
- Episode 1 – January 16, 2026 (released)
- Episode 2 – January 23, 2026 (released)
- Episode 3 – January 30, 2026 (released)
- Episode 4 – February 6, 2026 (released)
- Episode 5 – February 13, 2026 (airing this week)

GamesRadar notes the season caps at 10 episodes but still intends to cover Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs after the current northern trek.

## English dub update
Crunchyroll launched the dub on February 6, 2026, about three weeks behind the subtitled stream so Magna could polish scripts after winter storms delayed production. Episodes 2 and 3 premiered together on February 13, and February 27 drops episode 5, shrinking the gap.

The returning dub cast includes Mallorie Rodak (Frieren), Jill Harris (Fern), Jordan Dash Cruz (Stark), Clifford Chapin (Himmel), Christopher Guerrero (Eisen), and Jason Douglas (Heiter), while Brian Mathis joins as the legendary Hero of the South in flashbacks.

## Availability
Crunchyroll streams the Japanese episodes + dubbed episodes worldwide. Netflix is expected to pick up the season about 18–24 months after broadcast, like season 1.

## Story focus
The current anime run is adapting Continued Northern Travels and will move on to Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs before the season finale. Fans can track Frieren deepening relationships with new mages and confronting the Hero Party’s legacy.
