## Winter 2026 progress
Frieren Season 2 keeps rolling with the Continued Northern Travels arc. Each new Friday drops on Crunchyroll while the official English dub follows a few weeks later.

## Release schedule (JST)
- Episode 1 – January 16, 2026 (released)
- Episode 2 – January 23, 2026 (released)
- Episode 3 – January 30, 2026 (released)
- Episode 4 – February 6, 2026 (released)
- Episode 5 – February 13, 2026 (released)
- (No new episode on February 20; the break gives the staff time to shift gears toward the Divine Revolte arc.)
- Episode 6 – February 27, 2026
- Episode 7 – March 6, 2026
- Episode 8 – March 13, 2026
- Episode 9 – March 20, 2026
- Episode 10 – March 27, 2026

New episodes air on Fridays at 7:00 a.m. PT / 10:00 a.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. GMT (FinalWeapon schedule), still keeping the Crunchyroll simulcast cadence while the English dub fills in the gap a few weeks later.

GamesRadar notes the season caps at 10 episodes but still intends to cover Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs after the current northern trek.

## English dub update
Crunchyroll launched the dub on February 6, 2026, about three weeks behind the subtitled stream so Magna could polish scripts after winter storms delayed production (Storm Fern, in particular, pushed the release of episodes 2 and 3). Episodes 2 and 3 premiered together on February 13, and February 27 drops episode 5, shrinking the gap.

The returning dub cast includes Mallorie Rodak (Frieren), Jill Harris (Fern), Jordan Dash Cruz (Stark), Clifford Chapin (Himmel), Christopher Guerrero (Eisen), and Jason Douglas (Heiter), while Brian Mathis joins as the legendary Hero of the South in flashbacks.

## Availability
Crunchyroll streams the Japanese episodes + dubbed episodes worldwide. Netflix is expected to pick up the season about 18–24 months after broadcast, like season 1.

## Story focus
The current anime run is adapting Continued Northern Travels and will move on to Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs before the season finale. Fans can track Frieren deepening relationships with new mages and confronting the Hero Party’s legacy.

## Season pacing & arc coverage
Firstpost notes that Season 2 only spans roughly ten episodes, so Smile Studios is zeroing in on a couple of story arcs (Continued Northern Travels and Divine Revolte) instead of stretching across the entire manga right away. That condensed cour explains the war-torn Divine Revolte key visual and Shinichiro Miki’s casting as the titular Revolte—Crunchyroll’s weekly Fridays will need to juggle emotional journeys alongside high-stakes political tension for each new installment.

## Divine Revolte arc spotlight
The official Feb 13 visual for the upcoming “Shingi no Revolte” (Divine Revolte) arc shows Frieren, Fern, Stark, and the new Noris allies beneath a dusky, ruined skyline while the eponymous Revolte looms above. The arc is slated to start on Feb 27 with a mysterious new antagonist voiced by Shinichiro Miki, marking a tonal shift toward rebuilding in the wake of the Northern Travels storyline and teasing a larger threat that already hovers over the party.

Details from Firstpost add that the arc adapts Volume 8 of the manga, and the key visual purposely draws the party into a war-torn backdrop to signal that even a “cozy” arc can welcome proper demon villains. The article reiterates that Smile’s streamlined Season 2 runs roughly ten episodes, so the Divine Revolte entry will be one of the few arcs the cour focuses on—expect heightened pacing even as Frieren and co. continue to honor their slower, reflective roots.

## Break week & Golden Land tease
A Feb 20 break precedes the Divine Revolte premiere; the official site (and now CBR’s breakdown) frames the delay as a deliberate breathing room rather than a production hiccup. The timing aligns with the Winter Olympics broadcast window, but the bigger payoff is that announcing Divine Revolte so close to its debut—along with a fresh key visual—gives fans confidence that the Golden Land arc is still on the roadmap despite the 10-episode cour limit. CBR’s report “Frieren Season 2 Episode 6 Delay Is Good For The Golden Land Arc” argues that the anime is likely gating Golden Land reveals until a few weeks before it airs, and that the action-heavy Divine Revolte run through chapters 71–76 may finish by Episode 8, leaving Episodes 9–10 to signal the next major villain (Macht) in rapid succession. Keep an eye on the official site for the next arc teaser; if the production is pacing announcements this tightly, Golden Land might be announced and aired with only a short lead time.

## Episode 6 delay explained
Frieren’s official X account confirmed Episode 6 (overall Episode 34) now airs on February 27 instead of the originally scheduled Feb 20 slot because Nippon TV is airing the 1500m speed skating final from the 2026 Winter Olympics in the same broadcast window. Animehunch’s write-up emphasizes that the week-long pause also serves as a soft launch for the “Divine Revolte” arc—Methode and the proctor Genau are back, Revolte (Shinichiro Miki) is the new adversary, and the new key visual solidifies the scarred, four-armed general looming over Frieren’s party. The article reiterates that the second season is still capped at ten episodes, so each installment has to balance the reflective tone the series is known for with these higher-stakes demon conflicts.

Fandomwire echoes the February 27 return and provides the global simulcast schedule, so Crunchyroll viewers can expect Episode 6 at 7:00 AM Pacific / 10:00 AM Eastern / 11:00 PM JST after the break. It also notes that from this point forward the anime leans into the Divine Revolte arc’s more serious mood, splitting the remaining cour between the action-heavy demon hunt and the legacy-heavy Golden Land tease.

## Episode 34 & Divine Revolte rollout
Nippon TV slots Episode 34 on February 27 at 11:00 PM JST (the Feb 20 slot is instead filled by coverage of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics’ 1500 meter speed skating), giving the returning cast and crew an extra week to properly gear up the Divine Revolte arc. Oricon notes that the Feb 27 return also marks the reappearance of Methode and Genau, who are dispatched to the Rufen Region to handle demon activity, so the show can transition from the Northern Travels’ quieter mood to a more intense demon-hunting vibe without losing its emotional core.

## Divine Revolte teaser notes
AnimeCorner highlights the new Divine Revolte key visual/teaser, confirming the titular demon Revolte is four-armed and towering above Frieren’s party in the promotional art. The preview also teases high-stakes action for Episode 34 while reinforcing that Shinichiro Miki voices the irredeemable general, so fans can expect the animation to lean into the swirling, multi-limbed choreography shown in the still.

## Macht’s profile
CBR’s latest analysis teases that Frieren is finally facing Macht—the strongest of the Demon King’s Seven Sages of Destruction—when the Divine Revolte Arc kicks off on Feb 27. According to the manga, Macht defeated Frieren during the First Mage Exam roughly 600 years ago and remains one of the only demons who has ever beaten her. He respects Frieren’s magic but shows no remorse for his countless atrocities.

Macht’s cruelty is extreme: he lacks empathy yet studies emotions like guilt by forcing victims to kill for him, as detailed in the article, which paints him as the coldest villain Frieren has met. Even after gaining power beyond her earlier self, Frieren still hesitates to face Macht because of the trauma of their first encounter, so the anime’s next arc will have to reconcile past defeat with current stakes.

## Revolte villain preview
Polygon reports the villain in the promotional art is Revolte, one of the surviving generals of the Demon King who is now taking the spotlight as Frieren’s next serious threat. The new arc will reunite the party with Methode and Genau—both first-class mages tied to the Rufen Region—and hints that they’ve been assigned to hunt demons there, so expect the upcoming episodes to juggle cozy travels with a tougher, more action-oriented mission.

## Episode 5 preview
- Crunchyroll drops Episode 5 on Feb 13 at 7:00 AM PT (global simulcast follows shortly after the Japanese broadcast), keeping the quieter, travel-heavy pace rather than a fight-driven spectacle.
- The first look hints that Frieren reunites with the dwarf Fass in a bar town while chasing the legendary Boshaft liquor he has been searching for 200+ years. Fass reveals he owes Frieren a debt that’s lingered for 80 years, and the group heads toward the Norm Company Territory to settle it.

## Episode 6 preview
- Crunchyroll will stream Episode 6 on Feb 27 at 7:00 AM Pacific / 10:00 AM Eastern (3:00 PM GMT), picking things back up after the mid-season break and keeping the Friday-drop rhythm through late February while the dub lags roughly two weeks behind the subtitled stream.
- The subtitled stream still leads the conversation since the dub is running about two weeks behind, so fans tracking plot beats should follow the Crunchyroll simulcast for the freshest clues.

## New visuals & music video
After Episode 32’s “date episode,” official art dropped a romantic visual of Fern in a purple floral dress and Stark walking beside her, along with a separate Frieren illustration showing her sporting Fern’s braided hairstyle—both clues that the story is leaning into Fern and Stark’s shifting dynamic.
The new visual feels designed to highlight the emotional fallout from their awkward date while teasing that Frieren is quietly observing and supporting their growth.

Kyodo News also reports that milet’s ending theme “The Story of Us” now has a special music video with the full song supercut over Season 2 footage, giving fans a longer listen to the track while the show continues to stream. The AnimeTV write-up confirms the MV includes scenes from the first half of the season and marks a celebration of the new cour’s moodier visuals.

## Mini anime & milestone
Oricon News reports that the Frieren mini anime series “Spell That Switches Hearts and Bodies” just premiered Episode 20, keeping the same chibi-fied “●●’s Magic” art style. The deformed designs (by illustrator Mebachi) help the shorts stay light; in the new episode, Frieren, Fern, and Stark gain a spell that shuffles hearts and bodies as a reward for a request, giving the trio a goofy, heartwarming breather before the Divine Revolte arc’s heavier tone hits on Feb 27.

The same Oricon story celebrates the manga passing 35 million copies in worldwide circulation, underscoring how Frieren’s mix of melancholic quests and warm slice-of-life moments continues to resonate well beyond the anime screen.
