## Winter 2026 progress
Frieren Season 2 keeps rolling with the Continued Northern Travels arc. Each new Friday drops on Crunchyroll while the official English dub follows a few weeks later.

## Release schedule (JST)
- Episode 1 – January 16, 2026 (released)
- Episode 2 – January 23, 2026 (released)
- Episode 3 – January 30, 2026 (released)
- Episode 4 – February 6, 2026 (released)
- Episode 5 – February 13, 2026 (airing this week)

GamesRadar notes the season caps at 10 episodes but still intends to cover Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs after the current northern trek.

## English dub update
Crunchyroll launched the dub on February 6, 2026, about three weeks behind the subtitled stream so Magna could polish scripts after winter storms delayed production. Episodes 2 and 3 premiered together on February 13, and February 27 drops episode 5, shrinking the gap.

The returning dub cast includes Mallorie Rodak (Frieren), Jill Harris (Fern), Jordan Dash Cruz (Stark), Clifford Chapin (Himmel), Christopher Guerrero (Eisen), and Jason Douglas (Heiter), while Brian Mathis joins as the legendary Hero of the South in flashbacks.

## Availability
Crunchyroll streams the Japanese episodes + dubbed episodes worldwide. Netflix is expected to pick up the season about 18–24 months after broadcast, like season 1.

## Story focus
The current anime run is adapting Continued Northern Travels and will move on to Divine Revolte, Golden Land, and Goddess's Monument arcs before the season finale. Fans can track Frieren deepening relationships with new mages and confronting the Hero Party’s legacy.

## Divine Revolte arc spotlight
The official Feb 13 visual for the upcoming “Shingi no Revolte” (Divine Revolte) arc shows Frieren, Fern, Stark, and the new Noris allies beneath a dusky, ruined skyline while the eponymous Revolte looms above. The arc is slated to start on Feb 27 with a mysterious new antagonist voiced by Shinichiro Miki, marking a tonal shift toward rebuilding in the wake of the Northern Travels storyline and teasing a larger threat that already hovers over the party.

## Episode 5 preview
- Crunchyroll drops Episode 5 on Feb 13 at 7:00 AM PT (global simulcast follows shortly after the Japanese broadcast), keeping the quieter, travel-heavy pace rather than a fight-driven spectacle.
- The first look hints that Frieren reunites with the dwarf Fass in a bar town while chasing the legendary Boshaft liquor he has been searching for 200+ years. Fass reveals he owes Frieren a debt that’s lingered for 80 years, and the group heads toward the Norm Company Territory to settle it.

## Episode 6 preview
- Crunchyroll will stream Episode 6 on Feb 20 at 7:00 AM Pacific / 10:00 AM Eastern (3:00 PM GMT), keeping the Friday-drop rhythm through late February while the dub lags roughly two weeks behind the subtitled stream.
- The subtitled stream still leads the conversation since the dub is running about two weeks behind, so fans tracking plot beats should follow the Crunchyroll simulcast for the freshest clues.

## New visuals & music video
After Episode 32’s "date episode," official art dropped a romantic visual of Fern in a purple floral dress and Stark walking beside her, along with a separate Frieren illustration showing her sporting Fern’s braided hairstyle—both clues that the story is leaning into Fern and Stark’s shifting dynamic.
The new visual feels designed to highlight the emotional fallout from their awkward date while teasing that Frieren is quietly observing and supporting their growth.

Kyodo News also reports that milet’s ending theme “The Story of Us” now has a special music video with the full song supercut over Season 2 footage, giving fans a longer listen to the track while the show continues to stream. The AnimeTV write-up confirms the MV includes scenes from the first half of the season and marks a celebration of the new cour’s moodier visuals.
