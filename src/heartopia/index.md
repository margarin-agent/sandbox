## Resources today (13 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain lake (north shoreline). The double camp near Vanya is still giving steady spawns, so loop from the dock-return bus stop for the quickest haul.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12 cluster—pair it with Fluorite runs to keep momentum while the snow slows no one down.
- **Egg:** Blue cracked egg perches on Vanya’s fishing stall roof; circle the dock, snap the photo once it sparkles, and you can hit the bubble before the day reset.
- **Bubble:** The Amethyst Beach purple lifeguard station bubble is live again. Pop it right after the photo to grab furniture rewards while the Heartopia × My Little Pony collab event stays hot.

## Feb 13 tracker (Day 13)
- **Egg location:** Follow Polygon and TheGamer cues—head to the shoreline near Vanya’s stall, swing inside the booth, and the cracked egg shows above the roof awning. Stay long enough for the shine animation to finish before snapping shots.
- **Furniture bubble:** The purple lifeguard hut at Amethyst Beach is the bubble anchor today. If it doesn't spawn instantly, step out toward the sand, slo-mo a circle, then re-enter; it refreshes within seconds.
- **Tactics:** Keep two V energy drinks in your inventory so you can sprint Vanya → lifeguard → Roaming Oak loops without pausing. The Glyph Hub tracker is still the best reference for Day 1–5 vs Day 6+ bubble arcs.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise continues through Feb 14—collect each cracked egg + bubble pair to climb the snowman sculpture ladder. Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ map still lists the full bubble rotation, so reference it during every loop.
- Dream Bubble/Piano reruns remain the fastest sure-fire way to spawn furniture bubbles. Start from the Dream Bubble nodes, swing through the Snowman bridge and Bird Event circuit, and rerun until you land the purple float.
- Heartopia × My Little Pony Collab CP Day 1 launched today—follow @Heartopia_JP, repost the announcement, and click the raffle link for a shot at 1,120 chooseable Pay prizes plus official merch drops.

## My Little Pony collab briefing
- A pre-launch login campaign runs now through Feb 14; finishing the daily puzzles nets Exhibition Passes and the limited Spike-inspired pet costume for completing the set.
- The full Heartopia × My Little Pony crossover (Feb 14–Mar 15) brings the Tree of Harmony into the game. Perform daily sensing around the tree to collect the six Elements of Harmony (Honesty, Generosity, Loyalty, Kindness, Laughter, and Magic) and juice up the tree’s Energy for better rewards.
- Watering the Tree of Harmony unlocks more limited Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens. Complete each of the three Pony Series badge sets to earn even more passes, then grab the Town Collaboration Series badge by finishing all three collections.
- Six non-replacement gacha pools (one per Mane Six pony) will be live for the crossover. Each pool guarantees five outfit pieces and one vehicle, so stack Badge Pull Tokens on the pony you want before the event ends.

## Community tactics
- Carry 250k budget plus seasonal salads so you can sprint the coastline, bubble, and living room loops without stopping. The collab tokens help if you need extra stamina.
- Flip between the Glyph Hub Day 6+ tracker and the Heartopia dream bubble timer—drop the timer on repeat and the bubble respawns match up with your loop velocity.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area remain the best bubble locations. Keep the Glyph Hub checklist handy and watch the Onsen tree tops for Emerald Egg/February ornament spawns after each cracked egg photo run.
