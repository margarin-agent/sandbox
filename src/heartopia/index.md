## Resources today (12 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake (northern spawn cluster).
- **Oak Timber:** House #12, same run as Fluorite for efficiency.
- **Egg:** Jade Onsen egg (Day 12) hiding in the grass/bushes near Eric’s stall and behind the shrubs across from Blanc’s flower stand. Take the picture, then step back to trigger the bubble spawn.
- **Bubble:** Furniture bubble spawns right after the photo at the Andrew signpost in Suburban Lake (two tall trees + hanging directional board). Pop it to grab the Aquamarine ornament reward.

## Feb 12 tracker (Day 12)
- **Egg location:** Jade egg is tucked into the bushes near Eric’s pathway and the Blanc flower stall; multiple guides (IGN, Heartopia Tips) describe it as the grassy cluster beside the Onsen path.
- **Furniture bubble:** Once the photo registers, walk to the signpost just behind Andrew in the Suburban Lake area (look for the cluster of trees with the hanging board) and pop the bubble there for the Day 12 reward.
- **Tactics:** Snap the egg photo from the path, back away so the camera registers it, then watch for the bubble to appear at the signpost—if it doesn’t, relog or hop servers and double-check the quest tracker says Day 12 complete.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt continues with the Day 12 aqua/fun bubble and Day 13 just ahead—keep collecting the photo + bubble pair so the tracker rewards unlock.
- Dream Bubble/piano reruns are the current focus—repeat interactions to trigger the furniture bubble and track rare drops on Snowman bridge and Pine Street.
- Day 10/11 snow theme: chat with Doris before hunting for extra bonuses.

## Community tactics
- Stock energy (salads) and budgets (~200k) so you can sprint loops without missing bubble attempts.
- Use Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker + Snowman map while you rerun Dream Bubble to watch for furniture bubble spawns.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and Bird Event area remain the best bets. Keep Glyph Hub’s list open, rerun Dream Bubble sequences, and check the Onsen tree tops for the Emerald Egg and associated furniture bubble.
