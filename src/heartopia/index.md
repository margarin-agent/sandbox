## Resources today (24 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Sea server collectors are hunting Flawless Fluorite along the home village ring—today’s crowd-sourced update pins the spawn near Plot 8 (just outside the River Well), while America/Global servers are still landing the deposit near Plot 4. Keep a short jog between Plot 7–9 to catch the glow before it fades.
- **Oak Timber:** The Wandering Oak has been looping through Plot 2 for the Sea server batch and Plot 12 for the America/Global run, so you can gate a quick swing by the northern cabins twice: sweep Plot 2’s porch lights, then pop over to Plot 12’s fishing trail to catch the second lumber drop.
- **Penguin gift countdown:** The limited-time Penguin Gifting event still has about 17 days left, and the 7-style penguin present bundle is trending as guardian chats share pastel screenshots. Drop by the East Beach vendor every evening to refresh your chance at the full set before the timer resets and the gifts rotate out again.
- **Bubble buzz:** The popular purple bubble at Amethyst Beach remains the quickest way to stack bonus drops; wave a warm drink up once the shimmer flares, wait for the slow drift, then pop it before the Tree of Harmony sensing line moves on.

## Fluorite & Oak check (Feb 24 recap)

- Glyph Hub’s Feb 24 post maps Sea server Plot 2 for the roaming oak and Plot 8 for fluorite (America/Global Plot 12 + Plot 4, respectively). A quick reply from @seungminpoca confirms seeing the deposit near House 2 moments after the report went live, so treat those plots as today’s reliable route before the spawn migrates again.
- Save a house marker and reload the ring path after the Oak vanishes; the updated timer still leans on the same inner path, so you can swap to Plot 12’s cabins and loop back to Plot 2 once the node resets.

## Penguin gift spotlight

The Penguin gift collage is circulating with the reminder that seven pastel present skins are still available for a little over two weeks. Guardians keep re-running the East Beach vendor, sharing helpful countdown notes so everyone can snag the final set before the limited run ends—if you miss tonight’s drop, revisit tomorrow and keep the tender vibes going.

## Daily Oak scouting tips
- Start at Plot 2’s north porch and circle counterclockwise through Plots 3–5; the Oak tends to pause near the water well before continuing into the Pine Forest edge, so keep your stamina bar topped so you can hop between those stops quickly.
- Use Glyph Hub’s visual map (see above) as a checkpoint: the ring road inside Plot 2 has a narrow sidewalk that lets you spot the glowing stump without orbiting the entire forest. Once you grab it, sprint over to Plot 12’s fishing trail for the America/Global spawn so you don’t miss the morning window.

## Codes & vault intel
- SportsRant’s Feb 2026 list highlights **b8n2k5l** for 2x Flawless Fluorite, 6 Rare Timber, and 10 Stone—redeem it from Settings → Redeem Code, then pop the rewards into your crafting queue before the next reset.
- Keep **SPRINGFEST2026** on hand for 10 Moonlight Crystals + 8,888 Gold and pair it with **m7r9q4a** (10,000 Gold) to fund a quick furniture rush or badge pull whenever you need another Moonlight Treasure Box run.
- The guide also lists high-value codes like `letsbuild`, `letsdressup`, and `letsparty` for bonus Wishing Stars plus Festival materials, so swap through them if your stash is trimmed by the Pony collab quests.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise runs through Feb 21 — pair each cracked egg with an Amethyst bubble to climb the snowman ladder and keep the Purple Lifeguard station rotating in the collab shop.
- The Heartopia × My Little Pony Collaboration runs from Feb 14 to Mar 15, 2026 (VG247 / IGN). The pre-launch puzzle chain hands out time-limited Exhibition Passes and unlocks Spike-inspired items; once the collab is live, daily Tree of Harmony sensing keeps delivering Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens.
- Specialty Exhibition is selling My Little Pony costumes, furniture, and accessory bundles—visit after your loop and plan a slow stroll so you can showcase any Tangyly snack cabinet builds.
- The Penguin Gifting event is live for roughly 17 more days with seven pastel presents; schedule a nightly vendor visit so you can share the freshly gifted styles with friends before the rotation wraps.
- Moonlight Treasure Box: Secret Recipes launches Feb 17—draw with Moonlight Crystals for the Tea Savoring and Taste Relishing outfit sets plus a Moonlight Special guarantee that completes all treasures within 12 draws.
- Spring Gift redemption code SPRINGFEST2026 yields Moonlight Crystal ×10 and Gold ×8888 until Mar 31 (10:59 UTC-5), so hit the town before the blossoms fade.

## Community tactics
- Bookmark guardian chats and share the Plot 2/Plot 8 report so people can sync timers when the Oak disappears mid-loop.
- Bring at least two V-energy drinks and the LunarNook coordinate collage before starting the Coastal Loop—Amethyst Beach bubble pops and the Tree of Harmony circuits stack up quickly.
- Post each Penguin gift drop screenshot and tag the East Beach vendor shoutout so others know which penguin style just appeared.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area still supply reliable bubbles. Keep Glyph Hub’s timer on repeat to know exactly when the purple bubble at Amethyst Beach will respawn.
