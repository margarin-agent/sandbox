## Resources today (16 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake’s north dock still rains down sharp clusters—run the snowy rim and sweep the inner courtyard before the mist refreshes.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12 continues to produce steadier Roaming Oak trunks, letting you knock out repeat drops while waiting for the Amethyst Beach timer.
- **Egg:** Vanya’s fishing stall cracked egg is blinking again; wait until the sparkle flares, then dash for the purple bubble at the lifeguard station.
- **Bubble:** Amethyst Beach’s purple bubble spawns reliably after the Tree of Harmony sensing waves—pop it immediately for furniture while Park Rangers reroute the coastal loop.

## Feb 16 tracker (Day 16)
- **Egg loop:** Start at Vanya, grab the egg, then cross through the Amethyst Beach boardwalk for the purple bubble; wrap the run by circling Plot 12 and tag the Roaming Oak node before midnight.
- **Bubble timing:** Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ timer still fits between the Snowman bridge, Bird Event, and Dream Bubble nodes—drop a warm drink at the start, then keep the timer in your second screen so you hit the purple bubble before the Tree of Harmony reset.
- **Pacing:** Two stamina snacks + one energy drink should carry you through the coastal loop, the exhibition run, and a quick guardian-chat check for strangers.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise runs through Feb 15—pair each cracked egg with an Amethyst bubble to climb the snowman ladder and keep the Purple Lifeguard station rotating in the collab shop.
- The Heartopia × My Little Pony Collaboration continues until Mar 15. Daily Tree of Harmony sensing still hands out Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens, with Town Collaboration Series rewards waiting after you gap-complete all pony sets.
- Specialty Exhibition is selling My Little Pony costumes, furniture, and accessory bundles—visit after your loop and plan a slow stroll so you can showcase any Tangyly snack cabinet builds.

## My Little Pony collab briefing
- **Tree of Harmony loop:** Hit the tasting nodes in order to charge the tree, unlock Exhibition Pass drops, and stack tokens for Badge Pulls. Keep the timer visible so you can teleport back before the reset.
- **Badge strategy:** Each pony pool guarantees five outfit pieces plus one vehicle; spend Badge Pull Tokens on the outfits you’re missing most before the reset forces a fresh shuffle.
- **Special rewards:** D.G. members continue to earn Exhibition Passes and pony costumes at milestone energy levels—share build photos in the guardian chat and tag the devs so the specialty team sees the café inspiration.

## Community tactics
- Keep the guardian chats bookmarked so you can share warm drinks for iced builds, post statues with protective notes, and warn others when strangers pop into town.
- Bring at least two V-energy drinks and the LunarNook coordinate collage before starting the Coastal Loop—Amethyst Beach bubble pops and the Tree of Harmony circuits stack up quickly.
- Post the Plot 12 Roaming Oak updates, the Vanya egg glow, and today’s community snapshot so others can sync timers.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area still supply reliable bubbles. Keep Glyph Hub’s timer on repeat to know exactly when the purple bubble at Amethyst Beach will respawn.
