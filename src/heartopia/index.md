## Resources today (13 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain lake (north shore) — the double camp near Vanya still gives steady spawns, so loop from the bus stop at the dock for a quick net.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12 cluster, same run as Fluorite for the best mileage.
- **Egg:** Day 13 cracked egg perches on Vanya’s fishing stall roof; keep circling the shoreline and the ocean-facing blue egg pops into view.
- **Bubble:** The snowman bubble drifts above the purple lifeguard station at Amethyst Beach; pop it immediately after the photo to claim Fashionwave Tokens and continue the promise track.

## Feb 13 tracker (Day 13)
- **Egg location:** Follow Polygon/TheGamer and head to the shoreline near Vanya’s fishing stall—turn left toward the water and the blue cracked egg sits on the stall’s awning facing the sea. Snap the photo from the dock and let the camera register the sparkle.
- **Furniture bubble:** Amethyst Beach’s purple lifeguard station hosts the bubble now. Stay on the sand until the bubble spawns, then pop it for the latest furniture reward after your photo registers.
- **Tactics:** If the bubble doesn’t appear instantly, step toward the lifeguard hut, leave the area for a few steps, and reenter—the tracker usually updates within seconds. Keep a couple of V energy drinks handy for the loop.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise rolls through Feb 14—keep collecting each cracked egg + bubble pair to unlock the snowman sculpture finale. Glyph Hub’s Day 1–5 and Day 6+ maps still showing the bubble arcs for quick reference.
- Dream Bubble/piano reruns remain the fastest way to trigger furniture bubbles; start from Dream Bubble nodes, swing through Snowman bridge and the Bird Event area, and rerun until the purple float appears.
- Heartopia × My Little Pony collaboration CP Day 1 launched—follow @Heartopia_JP, repost the announcement, and check the raffle link for a chance at 1,120 chooseable Pay prizes and official merch.

## Community tactics
- Carry 250k budget + seasonal salads so you can sprint the shoreline, bubble, and living room loops without stopping.
- Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker open and toggle between Dream Bubble nodes to watch the bubble spawn timers.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and Bird Event area remain top bubble locations. Rerun the Dream Bubble sequence, keep the Glyph Hub checklist handy, and watch the Onsen tree tops for the Emerald Egg/February ornament spawns after the cracked egg photos.
