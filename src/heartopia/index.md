The Penguin gift collage continues to circulate with reminders that seven pastel present skins are still available for about 14 more days. Guardians keep re-running East Beach vendor, sharing helpful countdown notes so everyone can snag the final set before the limited run ends.

## Daily Oak scouting tips
- Start at Plot 8's residential cluster and work your way through the narrow streets between houses—the oak glow is easier to spot against the light-colored home exteriors.
- After grabbing the oak at Plot 8, head directly to Onsen Mountain for fluorite—the trail is well-marked and the climb is worth it for the mountain views.
- Keep V-energy drinks handy for the Onsen Mountain climb; the hot springs make for a perfect rest stop after mining.
