## Resources today (25 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Sea server collectors should head to Plot 4 for today's Flawless Fluorite spawn, while America/Global servers will find their deposit at Plot 8. Lunar Nook's morning update confirms the sunny weather is perfect for a quick sweep.
- **Oak Timber:** The Wandering Oak is looping through Plot 8 for the Sea server batch and Plot 2 for the America/Global run. Plan a two-stop route: hit Plot 8's cabins first (Sea), then swing by Plot 2's northern trail (America/Global) if you're cross-server hopping.
- **Penguin reminder:** Don't forget to feed the penguins for special gifts! The limited-time Penguin Gifting event continues with about 16 days remaining.
- **Bubble tip:** Amethyst Beach's purple bubble remains the go-to for bonus drops—time your visit when the shimmer flares for maximum yield.

*Glyph Hub's Feb 25 visual shows Sea server Plot 8/4 and America/Global Plot 2/8 routes.*

### Sea Server (UTC+7)
| Resource | Plot |
|----------|------|
| 💎 Fluorite | Plot 4 |
| 🪵 Roaming Oak | Plot 8 |

### America/Global Server (UTC-5)
| Resource | Plot |
|----------|------|
| 💎 Fluorite | Plot 8 |

- Glyph Hub's coordinated post maps both server sets, making it easy to plan your route regardless of which shard you're playing on.
- @qiyusoul confirmed the Plot 8 oak / Plot 4 fluorite for Sea server early this morning, so those coordinates are verified for the day.

## Penguin gift spotlight

The Penguin gift collage is circulating with the reminder that seven pastel present skins are still available for about 16 more days. Guardians keep re-running the East Beach vendor, sharing helpful countdown notes so everyone can snag the final set before the limited run ends.

## Daily Oak scouting tips
- Start at the Plot 8 cabins (Sea server) and circle counterclockwise through Plots 7–5; the Oak tends to pause near the water well before continuing into the Pine Forest edge.
- Use Glyph Hub's visual map (see above) as a checkpoint: the ring road inside Plot 8 has a narrow sidewalk that lets you spot the glowing stump without orbiting the entire forest.
- For America/Global, begin at Plot 2's north porch and work toward the fishing trail—the Oak often lingers near the dock before resetting.

## Codes & vault intel
- SportsRant's Feb 2026 list highlights **b8n2k5l** for 2x Flawless Fluorite, 6 Rare Timber, and 10 Stone—redeem it from Settings → Redeem Code.
- Keep **SPRINGFEST2026** on hand for 10 Moonlight Crystals + 8,888 Gold and pair it with **m7r9q4a** (10,000 Gold) to fund a quick furniture rush or badge pull.
- High-value codes like `letsbuild`, `letsdressup`, and `letsparty` for bonus Wishing Stars plus Festival materials.

## Events & quests
- The Heartopia × My Little Pony Collaboration runs from Feb 14 to Mar 15, 2026 (VG247 / IGN). Daily Tree of Harmony sensing keeps delivering Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens.
- Penguin Gifting event: ~16 days remaining with seven pastel presents; schedule nightly vendor visits.
- Moonlight Treasure Box: Secret Recipes active—draw with Moonlight Crystals for outfit sets with a Moonlight Special guarantee within 12 draws.
- Spring Gift redemption code SPRINGFEST2026 yields Moonlight Crystal ×10 and Gold ×8888 until Mar 31 (10:59 UTC-5).

## Community tactics
- Bookmark Glyph Hub and Lunar Nook for daily coordinate updates—they're the fastest sources for verified plot locations.
- Bring at least two V-energy drinks and the coordinate collage before starting the Coastal Loop.
- Post each Penguin gift drop screenshot and tag the East Beach vendor shoutout so others know which penguin style just appeared.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area still supply reliable bubbles. Keep the Amethyst Beach timer on repeat to know exactly when the purple bubble will respawn.
