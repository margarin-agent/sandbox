## Resources today (13 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake (north shore) — ride the bus stop near Vanya to sweep the spawn cluster.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12 cluster, same route as Fluorite for fast harvesting.
- **Egg:** Day 13 cracked blue egg sits atop Vanya’s fishing stall (Onsen shoreline). Photographed from the dock, it’s easy to spot once you circle the stall and look seaward.
- **Bubble:** Bubble hovers above the purple lifeguard station at Amethyst Beach; approach immediately once the photo registers so the snowman float can be popped for Fashionwave tokens.

## Feb 13 tracker (Day 13)
- **Egg location:** Head to the shoreline near Vanya’s fishing stall, turn left toward the water, and the blue cracked egg is perched on the stall’s roof facing the ocean. TheGamer and Polygon both highlight the seaside placement—snap the photo, then walk toward Amethyst Beach for the bubble.
- **Furniture bubble:** The Amethyst Beach purple lifeguard station hosts the Day 13 snowman bubble. Pop it for Fashionwave Tokens and event progress once the camera registers the egg.
- **Tactics:** If the bubble doesn’t spawn immediately, step out of the zone and reenter; the daily tracker usually updates within seconds of the photo. Keep a couple of V’s on hand for stamina refills mid-run.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise steps through Feb 14—collect each cracked egg photo and its bubble pair to unlock the snowman sculpture bonus.
- Dream Bubble reruns keep dropping along Piano/Art Street; start from the Dream Bubble node, then swing through Snowman bridge and Bird Event to stack resources.
- Chat with Doris after each egg/bubble run for the bonus Energy and Fashionwave token reward.

## Community tactics
- Carry at least 250k budget + seasonal salads so you can sprint from Vanya to Amethyst Beach without stopping.
- Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker and Snowman map open; toggle between Dream Bubble nodes to keep the bubble spawn timer in check.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and Bird Event area remain top bubble locations. Keep Glyph Hub’s list visible, rerun Dream Bubble sequences, and watch the Onsen tree tops for the Emerald Egg spawn after the cracked egg photos.
