## Resources today (16 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake’s north dock still rains down sharp clusters—run the snowy rim and sweep the inner courtyard before the mist refreshes.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12 continues to produce steadier Roaming Oak trunks, letting you knock out repeat drops while waiting for the Amethyst Beach timer.
- **Egg:** Vanya’s fishing stall cracked egg is blinking again; wait until the sparkle flares, then dash for the purple bubble at the lifeguard station.
- **Bubble:** Amethyst Beach’s purple bubble spawns reliably after the Tree of Harmony sensing waves—pop it immediately for furniture while Park Rangers reroute the coastal loop.

## Feb 16 tracker (Day 16)
- **Egg loop:** Start at Vanya, grab the egg, then cross through the Amethyst Beach boardwalk for the purple bubble; wrap the run by circling Plot 12 and tag the Roaming Oak node before midnight.
- **Bubble timing:** Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ timer still fits between the Snowman bridge, Bird Event, and Dream Bubble nodes—drop a warm drink at the start, then keep the timer in your second screen so you hit the purple bubble before the Tree of Harmony reset.
- **Pacing:** Two stamina snacks + one energy drink should carry you through the coastal loop, the exhibition run, and a quick guardian-chat check for strangers.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise runs through Feb 15—pair each cracked egg with an Amethyst bubble to climb the snowman ladder and keep the Purple Lifeguard station rotating in the collab shop.
- The Heartopia × My Little Pony Collaboration runs from Feb 14 to Mar 15, 2026 (VG247 / IGN). A pre-launch login puzzle chain is live through Feb 14 that hands out time-limited Exhibition Passes and, once you complete all of the puzzles, unlocks a Spike-inspired pet costume. When the collab opens for real, daily Tree of Harmony sensing continues to deliver Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens, with Town Collaboration Series rewards waiting after you gap-complete all pony sets.
- Specialty Exhibition is selling My Little Pony costumes, furniture, and accessory bundles—visit after your loop and plan a slow stroll so you can showcase any Tangyly snack cabinet builds.

## My Little Pony collab briefing
### Event runtime & arrival
- The Heartopia × My Little Pony collaboration launches on Feb 14 and wraps on Mar 15, 2026 (VG247 / IGN). The pre-launch login puzzles, available now, hand out time-limited Exhibition Passes and reward a Spike-inspired pet costume once you finish them all. When the official collab launches, the Tree of Harmony appears over Cloud Island (take the Rainbow Ladder off Whale Island) and needs to be reawakened so the Mane Six can bring it back to Equestria.

### Tree of Harmony loop
- Daily sensing at the tree gives you three of the six Elements of Harmony—Honesty, Generosity, Loyalty, Kindness, Laughter, and Magic. Approach the tree, tap the Sense prompt, then return to water it and activate the silvered Elements on your Harmony Tree Awakening card (IGN). Resonating with other D.G. members shares their missing Elements, so keep teaming up until your card glows with the full six each day.

### Rewards, badges, and gacha
- Feeding Elements into the tree raises its Energy Progress Bar, unlocking more time-limited Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens with every watering. Each completed Pony Series badge set grants ten Exhibition Passes, and collecting all three sets awards the Town Collaboration Series badges (VG247 / IGN).
- Six non-replacement Gacha Pools—one dedicated to each Mane Six pony—drop five outfit pieces plus one themed vehicle; spend Badge Pull Tokens on the slots you still need before the pools reset (IGN).
- D.G. milestone rewards continue to mail Exhibition Passes and pony costumes, so share your builds with the guardian chat so the support team can see the café inspiration.

## Community tactics
- Keep the guardian chats bookmarked so you can share warm drinks for iced builds, post statues with protective notes, and warn others when strangers pop into town.
- Bring at least two V-energy drinks and the LunarNook coordinate collage before starting the Coastal Loop—Amethyst Beach bubble pops and the Tree of Harmony circuits stack up quickly.
- Post the Plot 12 Roaming Oak updates, the Vanya egg glow, and today’s community snapshot so others can sync timers.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area still supply reliable bubbles. Keep Glyph Hub’s timer on repeat to know exactly when the purple bubble at Amethyst Beach will respawn.
