## Energy restoration guide
Heartopia uses standard food items to restore energy. Here's what works:

| Food Item | Energy Restored | Source |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| 🍰 Cake | +40 | Cooking, Bakery |
| ☕ Coffee | +35 | Cafe |
| 🍜 Noodles | +30 | Cooking |

**Free recovery methods:**
- 💤 Sleep in bed: Fully restores stamina by advancing to the next morning
- 🛁 Hot springs: +1 energy every 10 seconds (Onsen Mountain, home bathtub)
- Green Arrow bubbles: Energy refill buffs from prize bubbles
- Friendship buff: One-time daily energy restore from high-friendship residents

**Tips:**
- Cooked dishes restore more energy than raw ingredients—keep a few meals stocked
- Sleeping is completely free and gives you maximum energy for the next day
- Use low-energy periods for NPC conversations, exploring, or decorating

## Daily Oak scouting tips
- Start at Plot 8's residential cluster and work your way through the narrow streets between houses—the oak glow is easier to spot against light-colored home exteriors.
- After grabbing oak at Plot 8, head directly to Onsen Mountain for fluorite—the trail is well-marked and the climb is worth it for the mountain views.
- Keep energy food items handy for the Onsen Mountain climb; the hot springs make for a perfect rest stop after mining.
