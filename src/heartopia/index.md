## Resources today (14 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake’s north shoreline keeps spitting out sharp clusters—run north from the dock and sweep the abandoned inn’s courtyards before the snow resets.
- **Oak Timber:** Plot 12’s forest cluster still dominates the Roaming Oak drops, letting you tag a second diameter while the Fluorite queue cools.
- **Egg:** The cracked egg is precariously perched above Vanya’s fishing stall awning; wait for the sparkle and then sprint toward the bubble before the timer ticks down.
- **Bubble:** Amethyst Beach’s purple lifeguard station bubble is back—pop it immediately after the egg photo to lock in furniture pieces while the My Little Pony collab rotates infamous rewards.

## Feb 14 tracker (Day 14)
- **Egg loop:** Start at Vanya, snap the egg after the shine animation, then swing past the Amethyst Beach bubble and circle through Plot 12; the LunarNook coordinate collage keeps the path tidy so you can move from egg to bubble in a single run.
- **Bubble timing:** Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ schedule on deck, drop the timer between the Snowman bridge, Bird Event, and Dream Bubble nodes, and follow tangyly00’s snack cabinet build inspiration while waiting for the furniture loop to refresh.
- **Pacing:** Keep two stamina snacks in your pocket—Vaya’s bus runs, bubble pops, and Tree of Harmony sensing loops stack up quickly, so double-check your inventory before starting the full circuit.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise keeps running through Feb 15—collect each cracked egg + bubble pair to climb the snowman sculpture ladder and keep the Purple Lifeguard station in rotation.
- Heartopia × My Little Pony Collaboration is live from Feb 14 to Mar 15. Daily Tree of Harmony sensing now grants Exhibition Passes, Moonlight Crystals, and Badge Pull Tokens once you complete each Pony Series badge, plus Town Collaboration Series rewards when you gap-complete all sets.
- The Specialty Exhibition sells limited My Little Pony furniture, costumes, and accessory bundles—drop by after your loop to preview the pony-tier outfits.

## My Little Pony collab briefing
- **Tree of Harmony loop:** Hit the tasting nodes each day to collect the six Elements of Harmony (Honesty, Generosity, Loyalty, Kindness, Laughter, Magic). Water the tree to charge its energy, unlock better Exhibition Pass drops, and stack tokens for Badge Pulls.
- **Badge strategy:** Three non-replacement pony pools guarantee five outfit pieces and one vehicle per pull. Spend Badge Pull Tokens on the pony you need most before the Tree of Harmony timers reset.
- **Special rewards:** D.G. members earn Exhibition Passes and My Little Pony costumes by reaching milestone energy levels. Continue sharing build photos like tangyly00’s snack cabinet so the specialization team can keep the café vibes fresh.

## Community tactics
- Keep a Glyph Hub Day 6+ checklist, the LunarNook coordinate collage, and the Tree of Harmony timers open on a second screen so you can jump from egg to bubble to collab rewards without missing a beat.
- Bring at least two V-energy drinks and a snack kit before starting the Coastal Loop—Amethyst Beach bubble pops and the bus-loop to Vanya’s stall can stretch your stamina quickly.
- Post new Fluorite and Roaming Oak spawns (especially Plot 12 and Onsen Mountain Lake) and tag the collab ref posts so others can sync numbers.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area still supply the most reliable bubbles. Keep the Glyph Hub timer on repeat to know exactly when the purple bubble at Amethyst Beach will respawn.
