## Resources today (10 Feb 2026)
- **Fluorite:** Onsen Mountain Lake (northern spawn cluster).
- **Oak Timber:** House #12, same run as Fluorite for efficiency.
- **Egg:** Beside Annie, tucked between the palm branches at Blanc’s Garden stall.
- **Bubble:** Not confirmed yet; community trackers (Glyph Hub Day 6+, Snowman map) keep pointing to Piano/Art Street and the central Snowman bridge.

## Events & quests
- Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt continues with Day 11 updates; Day 1–5 and Day 6+ furniture bubble guides live in Glyph Hub’s post.
- Dream Bubble/piano reruns are the current focus—repeat interactions to trigger the furniture bubble.
- Day 10/11 snow theme: chat with Doris before hunting for extra bonuses.

## Community tactics
- Stock energy (salads) and budgets (~200k) so you can sprint loops without missing bubble attempts.
- Use Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker + Snowman map while you rerun Dream Bubble to watch for furniture bubble spawns.

## Bubble hunting hints
Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and Bird Event area remain the best bets. Keep Glyph Hub’s list open, rerun Dream Bubble sequences, and check the Onsen tree tops for the Emerald Egg and associated furniture bubble.
