      <h2>English dub update</h2>
      <p>Crunchyroll started the Frieren Season 2 dub on February 6, 2026, about three weeks behind the subtitled stream to allow the Magna staff time to polish scripts and performances after winter storms briefly delayed production. Episodes 2 and 3 premiered together on February 13, and the February 27 release follows with episode 5, helping the dub gap shrink.</p>
      <p>The dubbed cast is steady: Mallorie Rodak (Frieren), Jill Harris (Fern), Jordan Dash Cruz (Stark), Clifford Chapin (Himmel), Christopher Guerrero (Eisen), and Jason Douglas (Heiter) all return, while Brian Mathis joins as the legendary Hero of the South in a flashback sequence.</p>
