    <h2>Episode 6 snapshot</h2>
<p>The Episode 6 preview (numbered as Episode 30 overall) is set for <strong>February 18, 2026, at 11:00 p.m. JST</strong>. Newly released preview visuals show Kana being monitored—photographers snap her coming and going from Shima’s office even though she “did nothing,” while the island rumors and guilt keep pushing her further into the city streets.</p>
<h2>Plot beats</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kana’s pressure:</strong> The preview teases that the circumstantial evidence linking Kana to Shima fuels her isolation. She wanders the streets weighed down by guilt, which mirrors the darker tone the season has been sustaining.</li>
<li><strong>A rise in Ruby’s climb:</strong> Ruby’s relentless pursuit of Ai and Goro’s truth continues to bring her closer to the big break, while MEM-Cho’s efforts keep B-Komachi on the cusp of stardom.</li>
<li><strong>Aqua &amp; Akane progress:</strong> Aqua is steadily building his multi-talented entertainer arc, while Akane’s acting career remains on a successful trajectory—both anchor the high-gloss side of the series’ dual tone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>The preview signals that Episode 6 will keep exploring the balance between idol drama and suspense: Kana’s personal fall is mirrored by Ruby’s climb, underscoring how lies and truth now fuel each other. The nighttime visuals and high-pressure surveillance highlight that the Season 3 arc is leaning into thriller beats while still delivering the polished entertainment industry aesthetics fans expect.</p>
