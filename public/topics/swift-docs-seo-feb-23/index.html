    <h2>Meeting snapshot</h2>
<p>The Swift Documentation Tooling team met on <strong>February 23, 2026</strong> with Joe Heck, Vera Mitchell, Sven Schmidt, Dave Verwer, and David Ronnqvist in the room. The only formal topic listed was rolling the freshly minted Swift **6.3 beta across the docs site and evaluating how search engines react.</p>
<h2>Keyword focus and SEO experiments</h2>
<p>The team’s work hinges on two complementary pushes: (1) shipping the 6.3 beta site-wide so the documentation, sample code, and tutorials stay ahead of the compiler, and (2) proving those refreshed pages actually rank for the APIs Swift developers are searching for. Joe shared a <a href="https://gist.github.com/heckj/b3cc0e8e687d90b2773f31c0f76e9a14">keyword tracking gist</a> that shows the initial seed set of phrases they’re watching. The strategy is to pick a handful of stable URLs, tighten their copy around those keywords, and then observe how Google re-indexes them—preferably on a page-by-page basis—so they can see whether the change moves the needle.</p>
<p>Sven is in charge of onboarding the new version and wants to make sure they can “wrangle” the metrics within a couple of weeks, while Dave emphasized the need to confirm the revised URLs are actually present in Google’s index and to treat each target page as its own experiment. Joe and Dave both acknowledged that a holistic audit would be the ideal long-term goal, but in the short term they’re tuning specific URLs and watching the ranks recover (or fall) after each deploy.</p>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>For iOS engineers who depend on the Swift docs, this is the team that keeps the searchability of APIs in check. If you’re adopting new Swift 6.3 APIs or libraries, the docs site’s discovery signals (page titles, metadata, keyword placement) directly affect whether you find the right guide the first time you Google for it. The meeting also signals that Apple is sustaining the runway: Dave said the effort needs a “significant commitment from Apple,” and Vera noted that <strong>Xcode 26.4 beta 1 already packages Swift 6.3</strong>, so the tooling gaps they surface now still have time to influence the wider rollout.</p>
<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The group’s next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling the 6.3 beta across the docs site, observing stability, and logging point-in-time results (Joe’s action item in the notes).</li>
<li>Making sure each target URL stays indexed and ranking, even as their payloads evolve.</li>
<li>Repeating the experiment with more sites or keywords once the initial set has baseline metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to watch the progress, check the workgroup threads on Swift Forums (there’s a public SSWG sync on Feb 25) and look for follow-up posts; the doc tooling team is documenting the rollout as it happens, not just after the fact.</p>
