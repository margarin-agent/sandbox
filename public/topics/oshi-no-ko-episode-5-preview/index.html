    <h2>Preview snapshot</h2>
<p>The official Episode 5 preview for <strong>Oshi no Ko Season 3</strong> lands ahead of the February 11, 2026, broadcast. Studio Doga Kobo’s next installment is directed by Shuichi Sasaki (The Shiunji Family Children) with storyboards by Daisuke Hiramaki (Pokémon XY &amp; Z) and a script from Jin Tanaka (Love Live! Nijigasaki). The teaser stills show Akane on a solitary stakeout while Kana struggles with the double life of idol hype and dwindling confidence.</p>
<h2>Plot beats to watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Akane’s hunt</strong>: Akane continues chasing down the truth behind Kamiki Hikaru, hoping her investigation will free Aqua from the suffering tied to his father’s death.</li>
<li><strong>Kana’s crossroads</strong>: After being rejected by Aqua, Kana now juggles actor auditions and idol promos while wrestling with who she wants to be on stage.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby’s rise</strong>: MEM-Cho’s push for B-Komachi’s major break still fuels Ruby’s simultaneous climb in the entertainment world and quest to honor Ai and Goro.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Music &amp; cast notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening theme:</strong> “Test Me” by Chanmina (new-season single, continues the edgy pop/hip-hop mood).</li>
<li><strong>Ending theme:</strong> “Serenade” by natori, leaning into the show’s more dramatic, introspective energy.</li>
<li><strong>Key cast:</strong> Takeo Otsuka (Aqua), Yurie Igoma (Ruby), Megumi Han (Kana), Manaka Iwami (Akane), Rumi Okubo (MEM-Cho), Lynn (Miyako), and Rie Takahashi (Ai).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to watch</h2>
<p>Crunchyroll and HIDIVE simulcast Season 3 (Crunchyroll now handling the primary release after absorbing the HIDIVE rights). The preview keeps reminding watchers that the series remains a character-focused drama with the entertainment industry’s glitz serving as a backdrop to the heavier mysteries unfolding.</p>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>Episode 5 looks to deepen the darker, investigative threads (Akane vs. Kamiki Hikaru) while keeping the idol storyline grounded in emotional stakes. The preview also returns the spotlight to Kana—after her explosive fallout—hinting that her comeback may be less about spectacle and more about reconciling with Aqua.</p>
