    <h2>Netflix premiere &amp; limited theatrical run</h2>
<p>Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is streaming worldwide on Netflix as of <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, arriving alongside a limited theatrical run at Laemmle Glendale (California). Netflix rolled the film out as its first major anime release of the year, giving the new original feature a wide release day and a colorful filmmaker spotlight via Tudum’s feature article.</p>
<h2>Streamer tale set inside Tsukuyomi</h2>
<p>The story reimagines The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter through the eyes of <strong>Iroha Sakayori</strong>, a 17-year-old high-schooler juggling school, part-time work, and a favorite virtual world called <strong>Tsukuyomi</strong>. When a glittering telephone pole births a newborn who grows into the self-proclaimed <strong>Princess Kaguya</strong>, Iroha becomes her producer, helping Kaguya stream, sing, and connect with a digital audience. As they chase success inside Tsukuyomi, darker lunar orders begin to stir, prompting a new battle between earthbound ambition and moonlit destiny.</p>
<h2>Shingo Yamashita’s feature debut &amp; stellar cast</h2>
<p>Director <strong>Shingo Yamashita</strong> (known for high-energy opening sequences in Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, and Urusei Yatsura) makes his feature debut with this polished, emotionally kinetic spectacle. He co-wrote the screenplay with Saeri Natsuo and leaned on <strong>Studio Colorido</strong> (Penguin Highway, A Whisker Away) plus Yamashita’s Studio Chromato. The film features <strong>Yūko Natsuyoshi</strong> as Kaguya, <strong>Anna Nagase</strong> as Iroha, and <strong>Saori Hayami</strong> as Tsukuyomi’s streamer-producer <strong>Yachiyo Runami</strong>, blending pop idol energy with the paranormal melodrama of the folktale.</p>
<h2>Vocaloid-powered soundtrack &amp; streaming songs</h2>
<p>Conisch scored the film, while several luminaries from the Vocaloid scene delivered the vocal tracks. <strong>HoneyWorks</strong> composed “Watashiha Watashinokotoga Suki” (&quot;I like who I am&quot;), an on-screen duet that captures Kaguya’s brash charisma, and <strong>ryo (supercell)</strong> wrote the main theme “Ex-Otogibanashi,” which also debuts as Yachiyo’s showcase performance in Tsukuyomi. Additional contributions come from <strong>Kz (Livetune)</strong>, <strong>40mP</strong>, <strong>Aqu3ra</strong>, and <strong>yuigot</strong>, giving the movie a lush mix of marching pop, glossy EDM, and heartfelt ballads anchored in the streaming culture that drives the plot.</p>
