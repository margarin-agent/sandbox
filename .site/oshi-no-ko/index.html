<p><strong>Crunchyroll release time:</strong> Wednesdays at 7:00 AM PT / 10:00 AM ET / 3:00 PM GMT (4:00 AM JST the following day), keeping the weekly drop cadence through the end of March.</p>
<h2>Episode 6 preview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crunchyroll opens Episode 6 (Feb 18, 7:00 AM PT) to a new chapter where the cast explores more of the scathing idol industry politics; the new drop keeps fans in suspense for the next big reveal.</li>
<li>Viewers can expect Episode 6 to continue the Scandal Arc heat, building on the Kana-led tension while foreshadowing how the younger generation manages PR storms and hidden rivalries. (source: GamesRadar release schedule update)</li>
</ul>
<p>AnimeCorner’s preview frames the next entry as the moment when MEM-Cho’s hard work helps B-Komachi hit a major break while Aqua stays multi-talented and Akane’s acting career glides forward. Kana has lost some of her earlier cheerfulness, and Ruby keeps rising in the entertainment world while still hunting down the truth behind Ai and Gorou’s deaths, so the Scandal Arc tension stays alive even as new promotions roll out. Director/storyboard lead Koki Uchinomiya and writer Jin Tanaka are credited for the episode. (source: AnimeCorner preview images)</p>
<h2>Episode 7 preview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Episode 7 (Feb 25 release) will likely push the Scandal Arc deeper into the tabloid fallout after Kana Arima is photographed by a weekly magazine, so keep an eye on how the public narrative shifts while Gorou/Aqua scramble for damage control.</li>
<li>Crunchyroll’s simulcast still lands at 7:00 AM PT / 10:00 AM ET / 3:00 PM GMT, so international viewers can plan their watch parties around the same time slot each week (source: FinalWeapon schedule roundup).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crunchyroll:</strong> global simulcast with English subtitles.</li>
<li><strong>HIDIVE:</strong> selected territories with English + periodic Spanish subtitles.
Episodes unlock within hours of Japanese broadcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crunchyroll now handles Season 3 simulcasts; the first two seasons remain in HIDIVE's catalog. New episodes need a paid Crunchyroll membership after the free-with-ads tier was retired, while HIDIVE confirms it continues to stream Season 3 for existing subscribers.</p>
<h2>Cast &amp; Music</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ai Hoshino – Akari Kitō</li>
<li>Aqua / Ruby – Kaori Maeda / Hinata Satō</li>
<li>Score: Yugo Kanno (continuing synth-pop/orchestral hybrid opener and insert themes).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community notes</h2>
<p>Episode 5 (Feb 11) is trending for its deep dive into SUR’s motivations, plus tease for the idol concert arc. Crunchyroll News &amp; fan blogs release behind-the-scenes content each week.</p>
<h2>Scandal Arc briefing</h2>
<p>A Feb 11 key visual marks the official pivot into the Scandal Arc. Kana Arima is shown under crimson lights with haunting reflections of the rest of the cast, foreshadowing the media pressure headed her way.</p>
<p>Latest headlines from Oricon News reveal the arc opens with Kana being set up by senior actor Azami Mako and ambushed by a weekly tabloid, which then tracks the fallout once the scandal hits the public eye. Expect the next few episodes to play out the psychological cost of fame while Aqua keeps the idol collective from spiraling.</p>
