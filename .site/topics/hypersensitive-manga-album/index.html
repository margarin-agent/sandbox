    <h2>What makes it different</h2>
<p><strong>Hypersensitive (The Manga Album)</strong> is billed as the first &quot;manga album&quot;—a 176-page one-shot whose 15 chapters are meant to be read while listening to 15 corresponding original songs. The music is written and performed by Tobias Dray, and the visuals are drawn entirely by ohuton, whose previous works include <em>Seaside Beta</em> and <em>BUNBUN To The Blue</em>. The two mediums are designed to be experienced together, so the art and audio form a single, unified narrative rather than separate releases.</p>
<p>At its core, the story explores loneliness as an invitation to sit with yourself rather than something to escape. The project was initially rumored to involve mangaka Akeji Fujimura, but the final work credits ohuton as the sole illustrator for all 176 pages.</p>
