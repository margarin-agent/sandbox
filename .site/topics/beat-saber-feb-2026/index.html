    <h2>New Shock Drop track</h2>
<p>On Feb 5, 2026, Beat Saber dropped a Shock Drop single: <strong>“Me Porto Bonito (feat. Chencho Corleone)” by Bad Bunny</strong> is now playable on SteamVR and Oculus as a standalone purchase (Steam listing price RM5.69). The release description leans into the hype, calling it a trending track and inviting players to grab the rhythm right now before the pack fades from promotional spotlights.</p>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>The Shock Drop model celebrates one-off, social-media-ready tracks that stay in rotation for a short window. Getting Bad Bunny’s latest on the grid keeps your ScoreSaber profiles fresher, and the reggaeton/Latin trap beat gives leaderboard hunters a fast, bounce-heavy workout. If you stream or record, highlight the sudden drop by queuing the in-game announcer lines and tagging #BeatSaberShockDrop so the community can catch the trending moment.</p>
<h2>Pro tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Steam listing notes “SHOCK DROP: Get the trending track ... now,” which means it shows up alongside seasonal bundles and doesn’t require a full music pack. It behaves like a paid “single” DLC, so you can own it without buying broader bundles.</li>
<li>The track’s timing is friendly for intermediate-to-hard routing—its tempo is consistent with recent reggaeton maps, so you can pair it with in-session cooldowns or push for perfect chains if you’re scoring for the week.</li>
</ul>
