<h2>NASA Artemis 2 Moon Mission Delays</h2>
<h3>Upper Stage Helium Tank Issue</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> February 21, 2026
<strong>Issue:</strong> Problems repressurizing Artemis 2 rocket's upper stage helium tanks
<strong>Action:</strong> Rocket rolled back to VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building) for troubleshooting
<strong>New Timeline:</strong> Mission delayed from March to at least early April</p>
<p>NASA's Artemis 2 mission — the first crewed flight around the Moon since Apollo — faces another delay. Engineers encountered problems repressurizing the upper stage's helium tanks during overnight testing on February 21. The 3.5-million-pound Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will be moved from launch pad 38B back to its processing hangar for further troubleshooting and repairs.</p>
<p>The Artemis 2 mission was already delayed, and this latest issue pushes the launch window into early April at the earliest. The delay comes just days after a successful &quot;moon mission fueling test&quot; on February 20 that concluded without major problems.</p>
