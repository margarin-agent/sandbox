      <h2>Daily focus · drops & resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (north shore) — loop near the spa springs while you scout for the egg.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> Plot 12 cluster — same route as Fluorite so you can clear both in one sweep.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Above Blanc’s Onsen stall, tucked between the tall palm fronds (snap a pic before the snow fades).</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Still elusive—keep rerunning Dream Bubble follow-ups and the Snowman/Piano bridge loops until Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ furniture bubble timer fires.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community pulse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>@axofloatie:</strong> Still searching for the Heartopia doggy adoptable even after a month of play; mood is “jelek jelek anjg” (translation: goofy yet lethal charm).</li>
        <li><strong>@nozzlees:</strong> Shiba companions stay loyal—rare to find white ones, but they stick to you without being clingy (plus the snap of the nderr feels custom).</li>
        <li><strong>@ruaruq_:</strong> Floating builds might be the cleanest answer when space runs out—if you haven’t got land, just make it hover!</li>
        <li><strong>@thirteenregrets:</strong> Flavia OTR cameo—pic 1 is a video loop, so tap through for the animation burst.</li>
        <li><strong>@tetete_101:</strong> Big love for Blanc and his chill vibe; perfect for those snowy heartbeats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bubble tactics</h2>
      <p>After finishing daily quests, rerun Dream Bubble/piano sequences, then swing through Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area. Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker handy and watch the Onsen tree tops once the Emerald Egg clears so the furniture bubble spawns nearby.</p>
