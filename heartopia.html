          <p>Question to the community: once the daily quest is finished, players should re-run the Dream Bubble/piano rituals instead of rerolling resources—bubble spawn is the new goal.</p>

      <h2>Resources & drops</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (Rairaa) — default spawn near the north shore.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> #12 (Rairaa) — same cluster as Fluorite, so one loop covers both.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Beside Annie between the tall palm branches near Blanc’s Garden stall (Rairaa) — reference images saved in assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Still waiting; Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker & Snowman page point to Piano/Art Street/bridge zones, so keep rerunning the Dream Bubble piano sequence.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Event alerts & quests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt:</strong> Day 11 update by Glyph Hub with Day 1–5, Day 6+ furniture bubble guides, and Snowman bubble locations—bookmark the URLs.</li>
        <li><strong>Dream Bubble quest:</strong> Heartopia Fess says rerunning the piano interactions after dailies is the best option to trigger the furniture bubble spawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 10 Egg Hunt:</strong> Vilkychan details the event’s coordinates; talk to Doris before hunting to unlock the snowy surprises.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community tactics & insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stamina prep:</strong> daily_didi99 preps salads near the tent so she can sprint loops while keeping energy high.</li>
        <li><strong>Money management:</strong> yuwpies & keizumis stay within daily budgets (~200k) plus redeem codes to conserve funds.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-daily plan:</strong> players (via Heartopia Fess replies) now focus on Dream Bubble/piano reruns instead of grinding, making the bubble spawn the new main objective.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowy event vibe:</strong> Vilkychan’s 10 Feb note confirms the event’s progression (snowy theme) and extra bonus for interacting with Doris.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bubble hunting hints</h2>
      <p>Focus on Piano/Art Street, the Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area. Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ furniture bubble list open on your phone, re-trigger the Dream Bubble quest, and pop every bubble near the piano until one of the tracked locations (Snowman or Art Street bench) gives the furniture bubble reward.</p>

      <h2>Winter Frost Season snapshot</h2>
      <p>The seasonal update runs from January 24 to March 14, 2026 (daily reset rolls over at 6 AM server time) and centers on the Frostspore Infection sweeping Heartopia.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frostspore-infected creatures drop exclusive frosty fish and insects, while shaving snow into snowmen becomes a daily task (you can even become the snowman yourself).</li>
        <li>The Ice Rink Dream layout, glowstick concert week, and new construction around Onsen Mountain hint at upcoming figure skating content.</li>
        <li>New seasonal vendors: Blanc drops radishes, Massimo sells Frosting, and egg hunts plus the Silent Egg Grabbing Machine are already being seeded in the map.</li>
        <li>Frostbitten Skin unlocks after spending 8 hours in Frostbitten weather while wearing non-winter gear (look for the snowflake icon to confirm).</li>
        <li>Frame The Winter is a limited 2-player interaction unlocked after 7 days of friendship play during the season—each friend tracks progress separately.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Sweep Fluorite → Oak → Egg at Onsen/Blanc, then spend the rest of your session near Piano/Art Street rerunning Dream Bubble/piano combos and watching Glyph Hub’s tracker for furniture bubble cues. Keep Doris’s quest line open to unlock the snowy Day 10 event extras.</p>
