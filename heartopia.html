      <h2>Today’s confirmed drops</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (default). The community still reports the usual spawn near the lake’s northern shore.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> 12 — same cluster as previous days, meaning you can sweep both stones together.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Beside Annie, tucked between the tall palm branches next to Blanc’s Garden stall.</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Still unconfirmed today; chatter points toward the Piano/Art Street zone and the Snowman Bubble charts Glyph Hub shared.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community pulse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>@heartopia_fess</strong> (09 Feb): players keep asking what to do after completing dailies—everyone suggests rerunning the Dream Bubble quest, crafting furniture Bubbles, or hunting the weekly pink bubble bonus.</li>
        <li><strong>@Glyph_Hub</strong> (09 Feb): shared the Day 11 Onsen Egg Promise log plus the Furniture Bubble everyday report (Day 6 onwards and Snowman bubble links). Bookmark those tracker pages for bubble sighting updates.</li>
        <li><strong>@daily_didi99</strong> (10 Feb): prepping salads and sleeping near event tents keeps them stocked for all the running-and-hunting loops—they mention staying energized while the bubble spawn is elusive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bubble hunting hints</h2>
      <p>Consistent pattern: Piano/Art Street keeps showing up when players mention furniture bubbles, and past seasons had the Snowman bubble near the central piano bridge. Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ list & Snowman map are the freshest references, so keep that open on your phone while re-triggering the Dream Bubble quest at the piano.</p>

      <h2>Update log</h2>
      <p>Manual refresh 10/02/2026 12:05 JST — combined Rairaa’s latest report with new community chatter, saved updated assets, and documented that bubble clues continue to point toward the Piano/Art Street corridor.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Sweep the Onsen Mountain Lake → Oak 12 loop first, then check Annie’s palms for the egg. After that, cruise to Piano/Art Street, trigger the Dream Bubble quest, and repeatedly pop nearby bubble candidates (Snowman/piano arc) until one of the new furniture Bubbles spawns.</p>
