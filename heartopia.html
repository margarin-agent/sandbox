    <h1>Heartopia Daily Tracker</h1>
    <p>10/02/2026 · Synthesizing the freshest feeds (Rairaa, Heartopia Fess, Glyph Hub, and the broader community) so everything—drops, events, tips, and complaints—shares one stage.</p>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Resources & drops</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (Rairaa) — still the default spawn near the northern shore, so sweep there first.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> #12 (Rairaa) — part of the same cluster, meaning you can clear both after the lake run.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Beside Annie between the palm branches near Blanc’s Garden stall (Rairaa) — image reference saved under the updated gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Unconfirmed, but Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker and Snowman page both flag the <em>Piano/Art Street corridor</em> (Hands-on triggers via Dream Bubble quests keep cropping up in @heartopia_fess replies).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Event alerts & quests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt:</strong> Glyph Hub (Day 11) reposted the full Day1–5 and Day6+ location guide plus the Snowman bubble map. Bookmark those URLs if you’re chasing furniture bubbles.</li>
        <li><strong>Dream Bubble quest:</strong> @heartopia_fess is monitoring new gossip quest prompts—players are being asked to re-run the piano steps after daily quests, so keep re-triggering that sequence to get furniture bubble chances.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly pink bubble bonus:</strong> Community chatter (e.g., @bumient) highlights that grinding daily tasks + weekly pink bubble hunts is the steady way to earn ~20 weekly drops—so stack those when you have time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community tactics & insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stamina prep:</strong> daily_didi99 keeps a salad stash near the tent so the sprint loops stay fueled while waiting for bubble confirmations.</li>
        <li><strong>Money management:</strong> @yuwpies and @keizumis mention they stick to daily pledges (200k) and free redeem codes, keeping the weekly wallet healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-daily ritual:</strong> @heartopia_fess notes that after completing dailies, players are turning to the Dream Bubble/piano interactions + furniture bubble attempts instead of rerolling resources.</li>
        <li><strong>General vibe:</strong> Glyph Hub and the community streamers (TokkiCarotty, Vilkychan) confirm the event continues with the Day 10/11 egg hunt, so the quest flow is stable through Feb 14.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bubble chasing hints</h2>
      <p>Piano/Art Street plus nearby Snowman zones remain the best bet. Glyph Hub’s share of the Day 6+ furniture bubble list is the freshest static reference, so keep that open on a second screen while you trigger Dream Bubble sequences near the piano. If nothing spawns, rotate through the central piano bridge, the Art Street bench, and the Bird Event area—those spots have been recurring according to archived tweets.</p>

      <h2>Update log</h2>
      <p>Manual refresh 10/02/2026 12:15 JST — aggregated Rairaa’s 10/02 drops plus the wider community chatter from @heartopia_fess, Glyph Hub, and other daily posters, then rebuilt the page with unified sections. All sources now share equal footing through the “Event alerts” and “Community tactics” sections.</p>

      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>Feeds included in this update: @rairairaa (daily drop counts), @heartopia_fess (quest questions/answers), @Glyph_Hub (Onsen Egg Promise & furniture bubble trackers), @daily_didi99 + @yuwpies + @keizumis (energy/money tips), and secondary chatter (TokkiCarotty, Vilkychan) that keeps the week’s event flows visible.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Run Fluorite → Oak → Egg loop at Onsen/Blanc, then spend the rest of the session near Piano/Art Street bouncing Dream Bubble quests, popping any piano/flower bubbles you see, and bookmarking the Glyph Hub tracker URLs so you can compare today’s pattern to Day 6+ references.</p>
