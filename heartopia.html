          <p>Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt continues (Day 11) with Day 1–5 and Day 6+ furniture bubble links plus the Snowman bubble locations—bookmark that tracker before retrying bubble spawns.</p>

          <p>Question for the community: once the daily quest is done, players are spinning the Dream Bubble/piano sequence and checking the furniture bubble spawn—so re-run those interactions instead of looping resources.</p>

      <h2>Resources & drops</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (Rairaa) — still the default spawn near the northern shore, so sweep there first.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> #12 (Rairaa) — part of the same cluster, meaning you can clear both after the lake run.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Beside Annie between the palm branches near Blanc’s Garden stall (Rairaa) — image reference saved under the updated gallery.</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Unconfirmed, but Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker and Snowman page both pinpoint the Piano/Art Street corridor and the central Snowman bubble near the piano bridge.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Event alerts & quests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onsen Egg Promise Treasure Hunt:</strong> Glyph Hub (Day 11) reposted Day 1–5 and Day 6+ furniture bubble guides plus Snowman bubble links—those pages are the freshest static references to keep open.</li>
        <li><strong>Dream Bubble quest:</strong> Heartopia Fess encourages rerunning the piano interactions after dailies since the furniture bubble spawn keeps appearing in that loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly pink bubble bonus:</strong> Community chatter (e.g., @bumient) highlights that daily + weekly bubble hunts can net ~20 weekly drops, so stack those attempts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community tactics & insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stamina prep:</strong> daily_didi99 stores salads near the tent so they can sprint through loops while waiting for bubble confirmations.</li>
        <li><strong>Money management:</strong> @yuwpies and @keizumis mention they stick to daily pledges (around 200k) and redeem codes to keep funds ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-daily ritual:</strong> @heartopia_fess suggests Dream Bubble/piano reruns, confirming that’s become the standard “what to do after dailies” routine.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowy event vibe:</strong> Vilkychan’s Day 10 announcement reminds everyone to chat with Doris before hunting; event map includes Blanc’s stall and Town bubble spots.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bubble hunting hints</h2>
      <p>Piano/Art Street plus nearby Snowman zones remain the best bet. Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ furniture bubble list is the freshest static reference, so keep that open while you trigger Dream Bubble sequences near the piano. Rotate through the piano bridge, Art Street bench, Bird Event area, and the Snowman patch until the bubble spawns.</p>

      <h2>Update log</h2>
      <p>Manual refresh 10/02/2026 12:25 JST — combined Rairaa’s resource counts with the Heartopia Fess/ Glyph Hub/Vilkychan feed, documented the event/trick info, and rebuilt the tweet capsule so every referenced tweet has equal weight and direct links.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>Feeds included: @rairairaa, @heartopia_fess, @Glyph_Hub, @Vilkychan, plus the general replies/mentions captured from the community timeline. No single account is privileged—each tweet in the capsule links back to its source.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>Sweep Fluorite → Oak → Egg at Onsen / Blanc, then head to Piano/Art Street for Dream Bubble reruns and bubble pop attempts. Keep Glyph Hub’s tracker (Day 6+ + Snowman bubble) open and watch the Razor event map that Vilkychan shared for the day’s coordinates.</p>
