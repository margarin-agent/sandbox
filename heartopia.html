          <p>Collab hype is going full speed: Iupfan Williams and friends dropped a neon roundup of Heartopia + Nachisu MikuX raids, plus a note that the #Collaboration and #besties energy keeps the community looping for new drops.</p>

          <p>Cooking alert: after a harvest-heavy morning, Mairiro finally turns to the stove—truffle on deck and a reminder that Heartopia’s seasonal recipes are just as relaxing as its gathering loop.</p>

      <h2>Event highlights · Heartopia × My Little Pony</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Event window: Feb 14 through Mar 24, with a preview that already started Feb 7 and the pre-launch login puzzles handing out Exhibition Passes plus the Spike pet costume.</li>
        <li>Golden Acorn merchants unlock Pony-specific outfits, vehicles, and décor; collect the required number of collaboration-exclusive vehicles to earn Exhibition Passes and the laser-effect “Harmony Core”.</li>
        <li>Restoring the Tree of Harmony on Whale Island powers each Element (Honesty, Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Loyalty, Magic) for rewards like Moonlight Crystals, Badge Pull Tokens, and Town Collaboration badges.</li>
        <li>DG Guild watering mechanics boost the Tree’s resonance; coordinate with friends to keep the energy meter topped up so Pony Series badges (and the Town badges that follow) stay on track.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Pony Series badges & rewards</h2>
      <p>VG247 and Heartopia.gg both highlight the pre-launch login puzzles that pump out limited-time passes, while the Feb 14–Mar 15 window keeps filling the Tree of Harmony with daily watering.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watering the Tree of Harmony earns Elements of Harmony and charges up milestone rewards—more Exhibition Passes, Badge Pull Tokens, and Moonlight Crystals unlock as the tree strengthens.</li>
        <li>Badge Pull Tokens buy Pony Series badges; completing each of the three badge sets awards ten more time-limited Exhibition Passes, and finishing all three unlocks the Town Collaboration Series badges.</li>
        <li>Six Mane 6 gacha pools (one per pony) drop five outfits plus a dedicated vehicle. The no-duplicate/"blind box" badge pulls let you trade extras with friends or swap them for other goodies, so every pull pushes progress forward.</li>
        <li>Collect every Mane 6 item to unlock the Harmony Car rainbow mount, and keep logging in to claim the Spike pet skin while the pre-launch puzzles are still active.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Onsen Egg Promise · latest</h2>
      <p>VG247 just added the Day 12 location to their Onsen Egg Promise guide—photographing each new egg earns Wishing Stars plus Fashionwave Tokens, and the hunt drops a new collectible once per real calendar day.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 12 – Aquamarine Cracked Egg (Feb 11):</strong> Walk away from the ice rink stairs, turn toward the palm tree opposite Massimo's kitchen, and peek behind the low bush—the egg hides there.</li>
        <li>Each egg photo grants 5 Wishing Stars + 300 Fashionwave Tokens; collecting all 16 unlocks the Onsen Eggs recipe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep checking VG247’s tracker for Day 13 and beyond—most new spots stay near the Onsen Mountain vendors and domed building.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Daily focus · drops & resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (north shore) — loop near the spa springs while you scout for the egg.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> Plot 12 cluster — same route as Fluorite so you can clear both in one sweep.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Above Blanc’s Onsen stall, tucked between the tall palm fronds (snap a pic before the snow fades).</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Still elusive—keep rerunning Dream Bubble follow-ups and the Snowman/Piano bridge loops until Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ furniture bubble timer fires.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Community pulse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>@axofloatie:</strong> Still searching for the Heartopia doggy adoptable even after a month of play; mood is “jelek jelek anjg” (translation: goofy yet lethal charm).</li>
        <li><strong>@nozzlees:</strong> Shiba companions stay loyal—rare to find white ones, but they stick to you without being clingy (plus the snap of the nderr feels custom).</li>
        <li><strong>@ruaruq_:</strong> Floating builds might be the cleanest answer when space runs out—if you haven’t got land, just make it hover!</li>
        <li><strong>@thirteenregrets:</strong> Flavia OTR cameo—pic 1 is a video loop, so tap through for the animation burst.</li>
        <li><strong>@tetete_101:</strong> Big love for Blanc and his chill vibe; perfect for those snowy heartbeats.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Bubble tactics</h2>
      <p>After finishing daily quests, rerun Dream Bubble/piano sequences, then swing through Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area. Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker handy and watch the Onsen tree tops once the Emerald Egg clears so the furniture bubble spawns nearby.</p>
