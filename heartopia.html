      <h2>Event highlights · Heartopia × My Little Pony</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Event window: Feb 14 through Mar 24, with a preview that already started Feb 7 and daily sign-in puzzles handing out Exhibition Passes plus the Spike pet costume.</li>
        <li>Golden Acorn merchant showcase unlocks Pony-specific outfits, vehicles, and décor; collect the required number of Asymmetric vehicles to earn Exhibition Passes and the laser-effect “Harmony Core.”</li>
        <li>Restoring the Tree of Harmony on Whale Island powers up each Element (Honesty, Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Loyalty, and Magic) for rewards like Moonlight Crystals, Badge Pull Tokens, and Town Collaboration badges.</li>
        <li>DG Guild watering mechanics boost the Tree’s resonance; coordinate with friends to keep energy topped up and unlock Pony Series badges as you progress.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Pony Series badges & rewards</h2>
      <p>VG247 and Heartopia.gg both highlight the pre-launch login puzzles that are already handing out limited Spike costumes plus Exhibition Passes, while the main Feb 14–Mar 15 window keeps the Tree of Harmony growing with daily watering.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watering the Tree of Harmony earns Elements of Harmony and charges up milestone rewards—more Exhibition Passes, Badge Pull Tokens, and Moonlight Crystals unlock as the tree strengthens.</li>
        <li>Badge Pull Tokens buy Pony Series badges; completing each of the three badge sets awards ten more time-limited Exhibition Passes, and finishing all three unlocks the Town Collaboration Series badges.</li>
        <li>Six Mane 6 gacha pools (one per pony) drop five outfits plus a dedicated vehicle. The no-duplicate/“blind box” badge pulls let you trade extras with friends or swap them for other goodies, so every pull pushes progress forward.</li>
        <li>Collect every Mane 6 item to unlock the Harmony Car rainbow mount, and keep logging in to claim the Spike pet skin while the pre-launch puzzles are still active.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Daily focus · drops & resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluorite:</strong> Onsen Mountain Lake (north shore) — loop near the spa springs while you scout for the egg.</li>
        <li><strong>Oak Timber:</strong> Plot 12 cluster — same route as Fluorite so you can clear both in one sweep.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> Above Blanc’s Onsen stall, tucked between the tall palm fronds (snap a pic before the snow fades).</li>
        <li><strong>Bubble:</strong> Still elusive—keep rerunning Dream Bubble follow-ups and the Snowman/Piano bridge loops until Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ furniture bubble timer fires.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community pulse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>@axofloatie:</strong> Still searching for the Heartopia doggy adoptable even after a month of play; mood is “jelek jelek anjg” (translation: goofy yet lethal charm).</li>
        <li><strong>@nozzlees:</strong> Shiba companions stay loyal—rare to find white ones, but they stick to you without being clingy (plus the snap of the nderr feels custom).</li>
        <li><strong>@ruaruq_:</strong> Floating builds might be the cleanest answer when space runs out—if you haven’t got land, just make it hover!</li>
        <li><strong>@thirteenregrets:</strong> Flavia OTR cameo—pic 1 is a video loop, so tap through for the animation burst.</li>
        <li><strong>@tetete_101:</strong> Big love for Blanc and his chill vibe; perfect for those snowy heartbeats.</li>

      <h2>Onsen Egg Promise · latest</h2>
      <p>VG247 just added the Day 12 location to their Onsen Egg Promise guide—photographing each new egg earns Wishing Stars plus Fashionwave Tokens, and the hunt collects one egg per day until mid-March.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 12 – Aquamarine Cracked Egg (Feb 11):</strong> Head out from the ice rink stairs, turn toward the palm tree opposite Massimo's kitchen, and peek behind the low bush—egg tucked in there.</li>
        <li>Keep checking the VG247 tracker for the next eggs; each new reveal points back to Onsen Mountain, so keep the camera ready around Blanc, Massimo, and the domed park structures for the next spot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your egg photos score 5 Wishing Stars and 300 Fashionwave Tokens each, and all 16 unlock the Onsen Eggs recipe.</p>

      <h2>Bubble tactics</h2>
      <p>After finishing daily quests, rerun Dream Bubble/piano sequences, then swing through Piano/Art Street, Snowman bridge, and the Bird Event area. Keep Glyph Hub’s Day 6+ tracker handy and watch the Onsen tree tops once the Emerald Egg clears so the furniture bubble spawns nearby.</p>
